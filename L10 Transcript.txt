you're still coming in, can you come in as fast and as quietly as possible, please? I understand queues for coffee are long at the one hour mark. Thank you, if you're just coming in, just come in as quickly and as quietly as possible, please. Um, I'm starting this. On time because there's a, there's a tendency for me to overrun in this one. I've also realised I never did that. I normally do my very first lecture. I normally do a spiel, um, a very brief spiel, which says, the more excited I am about a topic, so the more interesting I find a topic, the faster I talk. So if at any point you do not understand what I'm saying, you are completely welcome to put your hand up and just say, I have no idea what you're saying. OK, and this may happen in this lecture, um, for reasons that will become apparent. So just let me know if I make no sense. Should have done that about 4 weeks ago, but hopefully, hopefully you've understood at least 80% of what I've said so far. OK, so. We are looking at abnormal development. So, specifically, we're looking at behavioural disorders, so antisocial behaviour. Now, you haven't had the tutorial on this yet. There is a tutorial, um, it's looking at this topic, uh, but you haven't had it yet. So when it refers to the tutorial, each year we run things in a slightly different order, trying to get the best, the best combo. Don't worry, you're not meant to if you haven't missed a tutorial, it's just coming up, OK? So why is it important to understand abnormal development? Now, you know, you don't always want to use the word abnormal. It doesn't mean anything in this context bad, anything negative. It purely means outside of the kind of range of, uh, maybe the first one or two standard deviations of a normal curve. OK? We're not making any judgement about the behaviour for good or bad. It's just unusual. OK. I mean, the first really important point is that understanding abnormal behaviour informs you about normal behaviour. Understanding normal behaviour informs you about abnormal behaviour. So any of those sitting here thinking you want to be a clinician, um, you need to understand what's normal first. Right, you really do. And I'm not a clinician, and I can't teach you any of that, right, so don't come to me and say, what do you mean? Um, I just mean it from more of a kind of, uh, general knowledge point of view, right? It's very hard to see what is abnormal when you don't know what is normal, um. The classic example would be sometimes the kind of um. Sometimes the stats we have. Uh, you know, out of date. So, for example, if you look at the criteria for something like conduct disorder, um, and you look at, you know, illicit drug use or truanting, um, if you get enough of those, you'll meet criteria for conduct disorder. Um, but at the same time, I mean, the proportion of 1314 year old kids who are smoking marijuana is probably fairly high. You know, it doesn't mean that you'll have a conduct disorder, right? So you've got to also think about context. You've gotta think about, you know, Are they functioning in life? Are they going to school? Have they got friends? Are they keeping their grades, and there's there's no disorder there. Like, doesn't mean it shouldn't be addressed. I'm not saying I'm not condoning it. I'm just saying you've got to look at things in context, right? Anyway, um. A language delay is a really a kind of a classic example you can think of is that because we have standardised norms when a child should be talking, right? And those norms are actually quite broad, right? They're pretty broad norms, and then, you know, they're based on large samples of children. But because we have those norms, we can now identify if a child is delayed in something like language acquisition or spoken word, right? And that means that we can then go in and say, is there a hearing problem? Is there ASD, all those kind of things. Um The other reason we want to early um identify early is because as we kind of mentioned in last lecture about the kid who may have, you know, difficult behaviours in kindy, is that abnormal development in childhood puts the child at risk for difficulties in adulthood. So the earlier you intervene. The kind of bigger bang for your buck you get actually in terms of intervention, right? You get bigger effect sizes intervening early purely because every year that you leave it, the, you know, the, the impact of those difficulties has increased, the impact on the child themselves, the impact on family, the impact on school, the impact on social development, etc. Yes. The earliest you could intervene for antisocial behaviour problems? 3. Yeah, OK. I mean, some people will, you know, do it earlier. Um, it's, it's, but early is quite tricky, right? It's quite difficult early because there are, it's so variable, right? Kids are, uh, developing, development itself is so variable. It's very hard in terms of something kind of fairly fluffy like behaviour to know what is, um, developmentally abnormal or not. The good thing is that many of the interventions, well, the main intervention for for antisocial behaviour is not gonna do any harm anyway. Right, so you, even if you do it, um, and the child is actually, you know, would have grown out of it anyway, which 50% do, um, it's, it's no real harm done, OK. That was a question about what was the earliest age of intervention. So, intervening early has been associated with better treatment outcomes, lessened impact on the child, lessened impact on others, and what the government likes, which is better value for money. Um, there are your learning outcomes. I won't dwell on those, um. So what can we learn from studying anti-social behaviour problems in kids? And by antisocial behaviour problems, I I specifically mean, um, ODD, which is oppositional defined disorder and conduct disorder. So we're talking about an literally antisocial behaviours. It could be violence, it could be aggression, it could be stealing, it could be noncompliance, depending on the age of the child, um. As I think I might have said before, um, in some countries we'll put, um, ADHD into the context of externalising disorders. We don't hear, uh, we, I'm not including that in here either. OK? It's it's, it's comorbid, right, for obvious reasons, um, just because it's, you know, a kid with ADHD may have difficulties that make it harder for them to follow instructions, for example, but it's not counted as the same thing, OK? So what can we learn? One, obvious one, we might want to learn how best to treat them, right? But how best to change behaviours. Um, we might also want to understand the developmental trajectory of anti-social behaviour. When you do the tutorial, um, you'll find out more about the different developmental trajectories and why it's so important to understand them when you're looking at treatment, um, and where, what, and on whom to spend government funding. If you're a researcher, right, and you're not just interested in the clinical intervention side, all of these things are relevant for kids with behavioural problems. So social cognition, moral development, family dynamics, impulse control, that's your kind of ADHD type stuff, or executive functions, that kind of area. Um, basic, basic mechanisms, right? Associative learning, attention, biology, genetics and environment. So there's loads you can research based on this one sort of profile. So you won't remember the tutorial, you haven't had it yet. Um, but we're looking at these, typically they come under these, these two categories. So the younger children, um, typically, you know, from like 3 to, I mean, it can be 3 to any age, actually, but typically, you might see kind of 33 to 1011, 12. Um, oppositional defiant disorder is when behaviours are non-compliant. There's more tantruming than normal. Um, there is arguing with adults or, you know, um, people in authority. There is, um, uh, kind of, Purposeful, uh, ignoring, shall we say. So it's like, it's basically what you would typically see in any child, but times 100. Yeah. The main point about it is, is that it's not within the realms of, like, typical for that child's age and developments, their developmental stage. OK. All kids will tantrum when they're 43, completely normal. It's about the frequency and the severity. The other really important one, the really important one that everyone forgets across the entirety of um the DSM is that there has to be significant impact on function. If there's not a significant impairment in either social function, family function, or the child's function, this counts for any, I think, don't quote me, I think for any mental health, um, diagnosis, right? There has to be the impairment in function. If it's not, it doesn't, not that it doesn't matter, but it doesn't meet criteria, OK? Um, the question was, is this the same as PDA, which is pathological demand avoidance? No, it's not quite the same. No. Pathological demand avoidance is very specifically related to demands. Basically, pathological demand avoidance. It's often within the kind of autism spectrum disorder profile. Often goes hand, it doesn't have to. Often goes hand in hand in that. It can go with a bit with ADHD as well. Um, so it's more of that kind of neurodiverse profile, um, and tends to be more an anxiety response to demand. Conduct disorder is kind of the big brother of ODD. You don't have to have ODD first. Um, most kids do. Typically, you'll see it in 10 plus. I have known 6 year olds with conduct disorder. Um, and it's when it's the, the violations are more serious. So you're talking aggression, you're talking, um, violence with weapons, stealing, truanting, absconding, um, Arson, stealing, that kind of stuff. OK, so it becomes more criminal. OK. If you lump them all together, kids with a kind of anti-social behaviour problems, they're a very heterogeneous group. So we have. Kind of colloquially we describe them as hot and cold. So colloquially within the kind of clinical area, these kids are often described as hot kids or cold kids. And the vast majority of these kids are hot. They're the hot group, so they're emotionally volatile. They tend to engage in reactive aggression, so they're not being, they're not seeking out arguments, they're just responding. They often have comorbidities, so anxiety, ADHD, um, they are typical for oppositional defiance disorder. And we know that the genetic risk is actually fairly low, it's not nothing, it's charitable that's there, but there's quite a high environmental risk as well, which is actually why parent management training tends to work fairly well on the whole, for these kids. It's not blaming the parents, it's just, you know, it's changing the environment of the child. In contrast, cold kids are minority, so about a third of these children, if not less, um, fewer. Uh, are described as unemotional, so they engage in reactive and proactive aggressions, they'll seek out aggression. Um, they typically have low levels of anxiety, actually. And we know there's a very high genetic risk, um, and very clear biological correlates. So the biological risk for conduct problems, if you have high levels of this kind of cold traits, is about, I think, 81, 82, um, 0.1, 0.81 0.82. It's very high. These are called callous unemotional traits. As we looked at in the last lecture, like 20 minutes ago, um, they were described years ago as, uh, psychopathic traits. OK, we've changed the terminology. Callous unemotional traits are not exactly the same thing. So a child with high levels of CU traits may not grow up to have high levels of psychopathic traits, but they are quite predictive. So low levels of empathy, low levels of guilt and shame, limited prosocial emotions, so limited kind of, you know, um. Caring kind of uh happy stuff and reduced affect.educed effect is a bit dodgy. We're not quite sure if that should go in there, but it's in there currently. Um It's defined by personality traits, so they're defined by descriptors of the child's, um, kind of values, how they view things, how they feel, um, but they're differently described by behaviours, right? So if you think about it, the parent might be rating the child on the interpretation of their behaviours. Right? So the question might be, do they show remorse for their for negative actions? Um, the parent might say no, so they're interpreting behaviour of the child. Yeah. Everyone has CU traits to an extent. Um, we're gonna, these ones have high levels of CU traits. These ones have low or normal. Yeah. So it's these traits that the focus of this lecture. Why do we care, you might ask, why do we care about a specific form of, uh, psychopathic traits or callous unemotional traits? What's the point? Um. Given that they describe actually kind of the minority of kids with antisocial behaviours, the reason is one that they have a highly predictive of future um offending, they're highly predictive of, um, Kind of violent and aggressive and consistent stable antisocial behaviour problems. Um, and also a certain kind of flavour if you like to behavioural issues. So. This little still there is a courtroom drawing. Um, these are two brothers, um, in court in the UK many, many years ago. I just whipped out the newspaper. Um, so these boys are in court, I think, for assault. I don't know which level of assault they're charged with, but it's assault. Um, what's different about this charge is that is the, uh, actually what they did and how they responded. So. What these boys did is they said these boys are 7 and 9. So we're talking middle, 7 and 9 year old. Um, they persuaded two other boys, about the same age, actually, about 7 and 9 as well, um, to an area of woods nearby where they lived. OK? The area of woods they had pre-prepared, so they pre pre pre-prepared it by kind of clearing the area. Bearing in mind they're 7 and 9. they had sharpened sticks. They had found all sorts of bricks. They had a sink, like a, you know, ceramic metal sink. Um, they brought all this stuff to the area, and they persuaded the boys there. They then spent about 90 minutes, um, assaulting them, basically. So they're putting cigarettes out on them, putting the sharpened sticks in the holes that the cigarettes made. Um, the only reason the boys survived is one of them at the end of the assault when these two boys had wandered off. One of them managed to walk to a kind of nearby, uh, housing estate. Um, and the guy that recognised, the guy that noticed the boy first of all, thought that he'd been playing with red paint. OK, so we're talking very serious assault. Both boys survived, um. What's particularly interesting is that there was a psychiatrist, obviously a forensic psychiatrist involved in this case, and when they interviewed. These two boys, um, She asked them why did you stop? Why did you stop the assault? Right. The youngest one said because my arms got tired. Now it's that response in some ways that's most indicative, right, because he's not lying. There's nothing wrong about that response in in and of itself, right, but it's kind of like what we were looking at last lecture. It's an honest response, it's a correct response, but it's completely lacking the understanding that he should feel really bad. Completely lacking the understanding that, you know, he, you know, you should say that we suddenly realised what they wanted to hear was we suddenly realised what we were doing and we were awful and it was shameful and we stopped. It wasn't that, it was completely honest, we just, our arms got tired. And the psychiatrist said that both boys, particularly the younger one, was incredibly high risk for psychopathy later in life. So that's why these traits are important because they kind of designate a particular type of offending, OK, that tends to be very severe. So what are the theories underlying these traits? So we're talking about developmental personality, effectively, uh, trait. That's present in childhood, that's, that's predicted to some extent of adults, um. Personality traits and behaviour, so. Let's try and understand it. Here we go. So the first theory that kind of came about concerning these traits was that maybe they just lack empathy. Right, full stop. They just have, they have no, no empathy. Um, I'm sure some of you will have heard many things said about psychopathy, they have no fear, they have no empathy, they have no guilt, none of those things. Um, so in other words, this, I know what the effect of my actions are, but I don't care. Right? That's the kind of one of the, one of the theories. And there is observational evidence that these kids and adults might lack empathy. They engage in proactive aggression, so they're going out of their way to, to cause issues. Um, they're more likely to be involved as a bully. Lower levels of shame and guilt, right? Um, we also have empirical evidence that they might lack empathy, so, um. In experimental tests of empathy, so ones that say, do you feel like the person in the story would feel? They tend to say, kind of, they, they score poorly on those. It's very similar to what we saw in the Happy Victimizer type task, right? They also have emotion recognition deficits as well, specifically fear and sadness like we saw with James Blair. Right? He kind of first identified it in vocal tone. We know that in emotional expression and in body posture, they're poor at identifying those, um, postures. So this one, for example, kind of a funny baby fit. But, um, it's fears the widened eyes, yeah. They're not very good at that one. So what does the evidence say? Well, research has looked into it, um, so we know that in colour unemotional traits, boys have, boys with colourless unemotional traits have an impairment and affective empathy. So they have uh uh impairment in the feeling side, the resonating side, if you remember social cognition stuff. Whereas boys with um ASD autism spectrum disorder, tend to have a cognitive empathy impairment. They have a harder time with the, as we've seen with the kind of theory of mind task, they have a harder time understanding why. Right, as we saw, they kind of Um, they can understand this as they grow older, but they tend to have a deficit in that kind of understanding why someone feels the way they feel. Boys with CE traits don't. But people with CU traits don't have a problem in that respect. So do you remember the discussion of the development of theory of mind in ASD. So in high functioning ASD, um. Explicit theory of mind was intact. Do you remember they're a bit later to develop, um, explicit theory of mind, but actually once they got there, they were abs absolutely capable, right? Same with second order theory of mind, no problems. However, in high functioning ASC, the implicit theory of mind or what appeared to be the implicit theory of mind, which was that eye tracking stuff seemed to be impaired. In high class on emotional traits, you seem to find an implicit deficit in empathy, but not an explicit one. It's kind of a similar pattern, but with a different area. OK. In other words, they don't have that kind of automatic uh recognizer and they resonate with you, but they can understand why someone would feel a certain way. So what could cause that's the question. OK, another hypothesis. We'll come back to these hypotheses. Another hypothesis was a low fear hypothesis. Some old one. Again, you'll have heard of this. They don't feel fear. If you don't feel fear, then your behaviour is not limited by fear. OK? That's the idea. If they have a reduced ability to feel fear, um, and therefore, that has a reduced influence on their behaviour. OK? So this will be the interpretation of I know what the effect of my actions are, but I don't care. I don't care for, for me this time rather than the other person. Again, there's observational evidence that they might have low levels of fear. So Harvey collectedley's original description, he was the first person really to describe psychopathy, forensic psychiatrist, I think, um. In that he described them as, it wasn't actually anti-social behaviour that he said, kind of mark these people out, it was low anxiety. So they're particularly marked by low anxiety, insensitivity to punishment, so they tend to respond poorly to to punishment. They don't change behaviour as a response. They demonstrate risky or impulsive behaviour, and they fail to recognise fever in others. And there's also empirical evidence that they demonstrate, um, a potential, uh, kind of reduced ability to feel fear when you look at the reduced conditioned fear response. So in a conditioned fear response, it's like fear potentiated startle. This is what happens. This is my, this is my human version of the rat paradigm. So, um, first of all, a person learns to associate a light with being retrocuted, right? A little electric shock, imagine a rat. That's the association that's made. Light comes on electric shock, unpleasant. OK? Separately, people will startle when a loud noise happens, yeah. Loud noise. Um, the fear potentiator startle is when, um, if the light is turned on, so in the presence of a light, the light that they've associated with being shocked with, if then that loud noise comes on, the startle response is bigger. OK, the startle response is, is potentiated by fear. The classic way to think about this is scary movies. If you're watching a scary movie, you're kind of find when you're gonna, you're gonna jump when something scary happens, but you're gonna jump more when it's like, right, when the music cues you and you know that something scary is gonna happen, that's your fear potentiated start. OK. So yeah, people with high levels of psychopathic personality traits have reduced. Uh, conditioned fear response. However, They have a completely normal unconditioned fear response. So this one, if you go behind someone with high levels of psychopathic traits and bang some symbals together, they're gonna jump just as much as anybody else. So what does that mean about the fear system? What does that mean is going on? They also this is very rarely reported, they also report the same levels of subjective fear and discomfort as non-psychopaths. So in other words, yes, their physiological response is dampened compared to non-psychopaths. However, if you ask them, simply ask them and say how scary did you find that? How unpleasant did you find that? They rate it exactly the same. So the low fee hypothesis doesn't really cut it. There's some physiological evidence, but there's enough evidence to show that the fear system, at least part of it is functioning normally. Um, And that's an important question, what does a physiological response mean anyway? Does it mean anything? It means something, what does it mean? OK, so they're too, we've had the low empathy, uh, low fear hypothesis, now look at the punishment insensitivity hypothesis. Again, observational evidence that these kids, particularly, but adults as well, respond poorly to punishment aspects of parenting interventions. In other words, kids who go through the normal parenting interventions typically don't respond as well as the kids with low levels of CE traits that go through the parenting interventions, right? So they don't respond to time out. They don't really care. Um, they don't particularly change behaviour. We also see the same thing in adult populations, so it's changing now, thankfully, I think I'm not, I'm not, I don't work in the justice system, obviously, but so I don't know. I'll be interested to know, but as far as I'm aware, for several decades, uh, psychopaths weren't allowed to be included in, um, Uh, treatment programmes in prisons. Partly because they didn't respond. The other reason was because there was, uh, some evidence to suggest that they learned social cues well enough to pretend that they had them, um, and then didn't, they weren't actually acquiring them, you see what I mean? So the kind of, some kind of manipulation. Thankfully, that's changed, and I think they are, you know. Our ability to treat has changed and they're now included. But that was because they didn't tend to respond. There's also empirical evidence that they demonstrate poor passive avoidance learning. Passive avoidance learning is when um. There's a button And you press it And then suddenly, and it gives you a $1 woo. So you keep pressing it. But then what do you do when instead of giving you a dollar, it takes away $1. What do you do? You stop, right? Now people vary on how long it takes them to stop. People with high levels of psychopathic traits go on for longer. Keep pressing. So, poor passive avoidance. So if you replace that with a shock, you see the same effect. Response reversal is the same thing, but now you've got two buttons, and one does reward, and one does punishment, or one does high reward, one does low reward. Most people will favour this one. And then suddenly when this one gets to be a really low reward, they'll swap, and they'll go to this button. Psychopaths don't swap very well. They acquire perfectly fine, don't swap. So it's suggests a serious learning problem. OK, so some kind of learning issue going on with psychopathy, um, as demonstrated by this video. Now I've got to get my little button ready cos I've got to hide a bit from you in a minute.

SPEAKER 3
Try, I broke the stick.

SPEAKER 0
OK, hang on, can you hear that? So there's a little boy, he's being interviewed because he was playing with fireworks and um. He, they burnt a hole in his pocket and he was in hospital. So just listen to the interview.

SPEAKER 3
I broke the stick trying to get out but I couldn't.

SPEAKER 4
Despite a serious injury, he displays the characteristic inappropriate behaviour which was much later diagnosed. Do you think you'll be playing with firecrackers anymore?

SPEAKER 3
Yes. Don't you think you've learned a lesson from this? Yes, but I'm still playing with him.

SPEAKER 0
It's really classic, really classic, he says he's burned himself, he's in hospital, he says, are you gonna play with firecrackers again? And you expect every kid to be like, no, it's just like, yeah. And she said, haven't you learned your lesson? he said, yes, but I'm gonna keep playing with them. Do you know who that was? Martin Bryant. You know who Martin Bryant was? Yeah, Port Arthur massacre. So that little boy grew up to be the guy that um. Uh, did the Port Arthur massacre. And the bit I covered up for you is they actually say he was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, which was, which he was. I know people who were involved back in the day in that diagnosis, he was also diagnosed with very high levels of CD traits. So, um, we, you know, whether the diagnoses were accurate or what, um, it's possible to have both. OK? Yeah. As far as I know, the the comorbidity between ASD and high levels of CU traits is um not particularly. Higher than any anything else or any other person. Um, the difficulty is, and I've done some work in this, is that the way in which we, the questionnaires we have for rating levels of, say, of ASD in the typical population, for example, they have many items which overlap with items for CU traits. So there are certain things that are similar across the two different, different reasons, right? But in terms of observing that behaviour, they look similar. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. So the question is, can you diagnose a child with psychopathy? You wouldn't diagnose a child with psychopathy, because it's an adult kind of descriptor. It's not even a mental health disorder, psychopathy. Um, but what you would do is, so in the DSM-5, um, there's a specifier called limited prosocial emotions. So for a child with conduct problems, there's a specifier in there, there are multiple specifiers. One of the specifiers is limited prosocial emotions. That is the To be quite honest, it's the, it's the kind of most nice way we could think of, of, not just me, people I know, of, um, describing callous and emotional traits. So limited prosocial emotions means callous unemotional traits. Yep, so you can diagnose it in kids.

SPEAKER 1
Mhm It could be either, so the question was, is,

SPEAKER 0
is that kid saying, oh yeah, I'm gonna do it again. Is that just not really caring for the authority effect, right, not caring what he's expected to say, or is it that he's kind of lacking that connection between the two? Um, it could be either and either in some ways it's equally problematic. So, um, you know, for kids, you need to recognise what the appropriate answer is, to some extent, in order to kind of get through life, to get through society. Even if, you know, other kids would say, No, I'd never do it again, but they actually would. Yeah, they'd do it again, right? But they recognise the fact that they're meant to say it. You know? He's either not recognising that fact, or he doesn't care, um, but, you know, he's meant to say that. There's no kind of emotionally binding thing between the experience and what he does next. So punishment and sensitivity effectively. OK, however, so there's some evidence for a learning issue. But neither children with high levels of CU traits nor adults with psychopathic personality traits are characterised by learning difficulties. So if you, if you're at school, they're not characterised by being in, you know, a special needs class or anything like that. Also, acquisition is fully intact. So kids with high levels of CU traits, adults with high levels of CU traits, psychopathics adults, and they learn to form associations as well as anybody else, right? So they, they learn to press the button, perfectly fine. Also, there's some evidence to say that the only punishment insensitive in the presence of rewards. So if there's no reward around, they'll stop pressing that button. Quite happily, um, but we'll get to those a bit later. So perhaps punishment and sensitivity is a partial explanation for what's going on, but it doesn't explain other deficits such as poor emotion recognition. So then the neuro people came in and they said, right. I think it's all to do with the amygdala. Fair enough. Mostly Patrick in about 1994, um. Now, broadly the amygdala is involved in lots of different things, emotion recognition, um, how many of you heard it's called, it's often referred to as the emotion centre of the brain. Yeah, that really annoys me, really annoys me. It is. I mean, I'm not saying it's not. I, I'm not saying you can't call it the emotion centre of the brain, but it does so many more useful, important things, particularly in terms of associative learning, so really basic functions, um, physiological fear response, fear conditioning. So if we look at empirical evidence to say the amygdala is important here, there's a lot I mean there's a vast, vast amount. It's been studied for years, um, so there's some evidence to say that the amygdala is abnormally structured in those with psychopathy. There's evidence to show that it's smaller. In there with psychopathy, there's evidence to show that it's overactive. And there's evidence to show that it's underactive. In other words, um, There's a lot of confusion. Well, there was a lot of confusion, I think it's getting slightly more understood now, but it loads of evidence, loads of research, all focusing on the amygdala, all coming up with slightly different, um, results. So there's some really great theories, but some really massive problems. In other words, there's no, at this point, no full explanation of callous and emotional traits, partly because of this, right? That it's not that they're deficient in empathy, because it's only affective empathy that they're deficient in. You can't say they're fear insensitive or they don't feel fear because it's only conditioned fear that they seem to have a deficit in. You can't say that they're punishment insensitive because it's only in certain conditions or contexts. The role of the amygdala is very unclear. The thing about psychopathy and callous unemotional traits is that they're actually really subtle. The behaviours associated with them are not, right, but the actual core deficits underlying it are really subtle. So we look at the behaviours, we look at extreme violence, we look at, you know, consistent, never changing, you know, mildly antisocial behaviour, and we think there must be something dramatic underlying that. The number of people on the street who will tell you that psychopathy is caused by child abuse and neglect is phenomenal. They all think they know the answer, it's not. So the behaviours look dramatic, which means you want to find a dramatic answer. However, what if you take a developmental approach? If you take a developmental approach, you can look at what minor deficits over time might do. So imagine minor tiny deficits present from birth. My argument, um, what they would do, OK, they do they snowball. So coming back to these things, there are 3 main replicated findings within colours on emotional traits and psychopathy. The first one is fear recognition deficits, right, this is a reliable finding. Things vary a bit in terms of which emotions, how strong it is, etc. but adults and children with or without anti-social behaviour. Another thing you might not realise is can us on emotional traits can vary independently from anti-social behaviour. This is my area of research. I typically use undergraduates as my sample. OK, that's not to say that some of you are psychopaths. It's to say that the traits vary normally, and any trait that varies normally in a normal curve you can use to um study. But there's two extra important bits of data to go with this fear recognition and research. So, um, if you've been lectured by him, you're lucky, um. In 2006, Mark Dads and his team The study looking at attention to the eyes and fear recognition deficits in child psychopathy. What they found was that actually um. Kids that were showing this kind of fear recognition deficit, when they looked at what they were doing in an eye tracker, so you actually look to see where they're looking in the picture, they're not looking here. They're not looking at the eyes of the image. They're looking down here at the mouth. Do you know what they did? They said, OK, when you look at the next pictures, just look at their eyes. Look at the eyeballs. Guess what happened? Suddenly, magically, the fear recognition deficit just went away. There's no fundamental deficit in recognising that that's a fear emotion expression, that is not looking in the right place. Why do you look at the eyeballs, do you know why? Why in the fear expression more than any other do we look at eyeballs? Yes. Yeah, exactly, you wanna see what we're looking at, it's automatic, right? It's evolution, so if I'm a cave person. Um, and I'm in my cave, right, and I see my friend over there, my friend over there is doing this. Right, but they're looking in that direction. I don't want to be staring at them. Going, oh my gosh, they're so scared, uh, I wanna be looking where they're looking cos there's a bear coming. Right? Fear, fear is, is an emotion that communicates something, but, and that's the reason eyes are so wide, so it's the dark white rat ratio of the eyeballs that is like an automatic. Thing, subcortical visual pathway. So completely separate research, not interested in psychopathy has demonstrated that there's a subcortical visual pathway. subcortical means does not go through the cortex. Yeah? Which terminates an activation of the basal lateral amygdala. So when in the periphery of your vision, there's a dark white ratio thing, i.e., eyeballs, the subcortical visual pathway is stimulated, it terminates in activation of the baselateral amygdala. The baselateral amygdala moves your eye gaze, OK? That shifts your gaze to the fearful eyeballs. Right? So if you're over here with a fear face and I'm looking this way, s, that's automatic. So that movement for me to look over there has to happen. Cos if I don't notice, I'm gonna die. Right, so there's certain stimuli that do that. That results in a shift in gaze to attend to the eye region of the face, that results in activation of the central amygdala and explicit fear recognition. So explicit fear recognition, i.e., that's a fear face, doesn't happen until the shift in gaze has occurred and someone's looking at the fear face. Um, what's really interesting in that is that, you know, if you, if you put people in an eye tracker, you stick people in an FMRI, sorry, right, in a FMRI and you look at amygdala activation to all the different emotions. Loads of studies have shown that when people see a fear face, their amygdala is super activated. Yeah. It's like, ah, it's fear. And the amygdala goes ah. If you control where they're looking, OK, so, uh, people have done this, I think game and shell, if I remember correctly, um. If you put a fixation cross here, right in the image versus here, you see a massive difference in amygdala activation. If the fixation crosses here on the mouse, you see massive amygdala activation to fear specifically. If you put the fixation cross here, you don't, there's none. The amygdala activation is moving the eyeballs, that's all it is. It's all it is. Moving the eyeballs to look at the eyeballs. Moving the person's eyeballs, as in the subject, to look at the eyeballs of the image. You have to move in order to look, and that's a base lateral amygdala. After that, of course, you've got downstairs processing and differences between amygdala activation following that processing, according to things like anxiety and stuff, that's a different story. That might, that might well be a thing. OK, um, so what would the result of this snowball be? Imagine you're a child, imagine you're 6 months old, you just don't look at the eyes as much as everybody else. 2nd 1, 2nd main replicated finding, um, poor response reversal learning. Passive avoidance comes under the same thing. So this is the example. You have a button, you press it, you get loads and loads of dollars every time you press it, you get a $1. As soon as you get a negative response. You take longer to stop responding, OK, so you get more negative outcomes than everybody else. What would the result of that snowball be? From early in life. Now don't think of it in terms of coins and buttons, think of it in terms of, say, social interactions. You could think of it in terms of poking someone else, right? This is a really classic example. You've got siblings, I don't know, 2 siblings, I imagine two little siblings, right? One of them, I can speak from experience because this happens all the time in my house. One of them likes tickling the other one, right? And the 1st 3 times that they tickle the other one, the other ones say, Hey, that's great. 4th time, the other one's got, had enough. OK, they just had enough, and they go, you know, they stop, stop, stop. And the other one keeps going. Not because they want to be annoying, not because they don't care, but because they don't learn in the same way. Right, so they keep going. They don't, they can't reverse the responses easily. What happens socially? Think about what the implications of that is across an entire um. Social network basically. So is this that they are punishment insensitive, are they reward dominant? Are are they super seeking out reward and they can't resist? Are they just insensitive to punishing stimuli? Or does reward and punishment actually not matter at all? In these scenarios, do they actually matter, um, or not? And it's a very difficult question to answer. We always assume that punishment and reward do matter. We start thinking about bispass and all those kind of things, uh, but we can't design experiments that put reward and punishment in equal opposition. We can't do it because humans don't behave that way. So maybe they're just less behaviorally flexible. Maybe they just don't change behaviour as quickly as other people. Third main replicated finding. So we had this one, remember? So psychopaths show a reduced condition fear response. Just to make it really strange, um, this article came out in about 2011, I think, maybe 2010, um, showing that attention moderates the fearlessness of psychopathic offenders. These are, these are criminal people in prison. Um, basically what they did is that you can read that, it's a good one, What they did is they did this kind of experiment with incarcerated er prisoners, some were had high levels of psychopathy, some did not. As always, they found the condition reduced conditioned fear response. They then said, look at the thing that predicts the shock. Same thing as you saw in the emotion recognition, right? Look at the thing that predicts the shock. Pay attention to that. Guess what happened. Conditioned fear normalised. Just changing where they're looking. That's it. So this is why I think a developmental approach fits this topic. Because these are subtle things. Whatever's going wrong is subtle and it's very tiny and it's hard to see. Um, and time is a crucial variable. Cause if you measure something in a 40 year old incarcerated psychopathic offender. Right? You, you're not gonna see subtle. You're gonna see really massive impact because of the interaction with the environment, right? If you've had differences in the way your brain functions from a very early age, that interacts with your environment. And that dictates in some, to some extent, your environment, right? So you're gonna see all those effects. People will have, they will have learned ways to manipulate people. They will have learned all that stuff. But that's not necessarily looking at the causes of where these traits come from. You need to look at kids. To do that. So you need to take a developmental approach in order to see the whole picture. OK. Now look, I'm gonna present a possible explanation and in the, in the realm of James Blair, I'm gonna be very upfront with you. I am biassed, it's fine. um. Two points to make on this. I'm not expecting this to be correct. This is 2012, this is basically my PhD, first half of my PhD. I don't expect this to be correct. Right? Because information changes, we get more data. Um But I think it's all right. I was gonna say that. I think it's all right. OK, so this is the theory. Um The theory put forward is that it's a differential amygdala activation. So the evidence about the amygdala doesn't make sense if you count the amygdala as a single entity. It's a single thing. It's not. People can divide it into multiple different bits, right? Typically, we divide it into the central part and the base lateral part. Central part is like lizard brain. That's been around phylogeneetically for Yonkeys years. Um, the base lateral is, is kind of new, evolutionarily new, mammalian. So the theory was that the amygdala is differentially activated in people with high levels of psychopathic personality traits. Specifically, the basolateral part is underactivated and that the central part is actually functioning normally or above normal levels. There's actually a kind of antagonism between the two. So activation in one will actually inhibit the other. So that's the kind of process that happens. So what does this theory predict um. Number one, The base lateral part, not the central part, the base lateral part is involved with the automatic allocation of attention. So when we look at evidence to show that there are deficits in emotion recognition, there's deficits in condition fear response, but when there's a top-down instruction, when there's a top down cognitively cortex driven instruction to modify your attention, these deficits go away, which suggests that it's the part that is kind of automatically, to what extent that can happen, allocating all attention may be wonky. In contrast, the central amygdala is involved with explicit emotion recognition and the physiological fear response. So logically, it has to be intact. It has to be intact logically because we know that when certain manipulations of attention are made, those things work normally. Right? If this part was underactive, then they shouldn't demonstrate the normal physiological sphere response in any condition. Um, the other interesting thing is that the base lateral amygdala encodes specific features of stimuli. So when we look at associative learning, if you look at the rat research, the base lateral and the central amygdala do different things. The base lateral encodes what is this? Like, what is it, is it $5 is it $10 is it 20 pellets, is it 1 pellet, is it sugar flavoured, is it chocolate flavoured? The central amygdala encodes, do I want it or do I not? Like good, bad. Approach avoid, that's all that does, OK? Which means learning parameters are different. Basically the mathematics of the learning parameters are just different. This is more sensitive, it responds more quickly, this one responds slowly. OK, kind of a general, think of this as a kind of general fluffy cloud. Of understanding this one's really specific. So if this one's not functioning, then your learning is going to be slower. But importantly, both can acquire. Like, both learning, this one's learning it's good, this one's learning is $5. Both are making you press the button. This one doesn't work. So when it becomes minus $2 this one's going, Is it what? Is it bad? Is it good? What? OK, learning parameters are different. Yeah. Generals It's slow in general, but if there's an imbalance between the two, effectively the base lateral is, is, it's shown in monkey, monkey brains actually, it's kind of specific that the prediction, it will respond to prediction error. So it'll actually find in different rates according to prediction error. Whereas the central is kind of more fluffy, which makes it slightly slower to adapt. That's the, that's the generalised version. So again, imagine your amygdala functioned like that from birth. Subtle, these are subtle things, these are not obvious things, they don't impact the way in which you are, in which you function at school, for example, it's very much social learning that it impacts. So is a psychopath born or is it made? By the way, I just want to come back to this for a second. Um. As I said, I find this topic very interesting, it's kind of what I research. Right, so I research, I've decided I've made up a whole new term. I've made up a term of the cognitive mechanics of psychopathology. That's what I do. It doesn't exist, I've made it up cos it best describes what I do. So if I say I, I look into cognition. People think I'm talking about rumination and higher order stuff. I'm not, I'm talking about associative learning, I'm talking about attention. I'm talking about very basic processes. Most of the time I do it in psychopathy, anxiety, and tolerance of uncertainty, that kind of thing. That's just if you're wondering why I'm getting a bit obsessive, um. So quick question, is a psychopath born or made? We know it's a silly question, why, why is that a silly question? Yes, thank you, it's both. um, but we know that CU trades are highly heritable. OK, they're highly heritable. The contact problems with them are highly heritable. Recent research though for those who are interested, has identified two types of psychopathy. It gets very confusing, people use the same terminology to mean different things. This is a more recent thing. Primary and secondary psychopathy isn't just talking about, you know, I about to say potato, that's not potato. Tomato, tomato. Um, it's not that simple, OK, they are actually different. So, uh, either Kimonis at UNSW is one of the first people to look into secondary psychopathy, um. Both of them are characterised by high levels of CU traits. And high levels of antisocial behaviour, they differ in number one anxiety. So anxiety is high in secondary psychopathy. It's low so I researched primary psychopathy, it's low in primary. I kind of classic psychopathy is primary, OK, the classic description. The sex ratio is far more even in secondary psychopathy, so high anxiety, more females than you'd see in primary psychopathy. And then the aetiology is thought to be different. So child maltreatment is associated kind of etiologically with secondary psychopathy, but not primary psychopathy. So the current thinking here is that primary psychopathy, the one that all the things I've told you about so far, concerns primary psychopathy only. current thinking is that primary psychopathy has a mainly biological, genetically based aetiology. OK? It serves both as a risk factor for anti-social behaviour and, weirdly, as a protective factor against environmental risk. So high levels of the traits themselves seem to have served a protective factor against, um, things like trauma, PTSD from child abuse and maltreatment. Um, studies that have looked at murderers, so people who've committed murder, they've split those into those with high levels of psychopathic traits and those who do not. Those who've committed murder who do not have high levels of psychopathic traits generally have PTSD from their own crime. Those with high levels of psychopathy do not. In fact, it's very rare to find PTSD in psychopathy, primary psychopathy. The idea with secondary psychopathy is that it arises as a response to abuse or maltreatment. So the biological components are still very relevant, but possibly different pathways involved, OK? So the other way people think about secondary psychopathy is in terms of reactive attachment disorder. So if you heard of that, it's kind of a response to severe abuse, maltreatment, neglect in early childhood, um. You might think of kind of uh child soldiers, similar response, so often those kids who've been through that kind of trauma can develop this kind of cold, um. Interactive style, OK, but it's different from primary psychopathy in that it's more of a kind of shutdown anxiety stress response. I'm gonna show you this video very quickly, um. I think we've got time, do we? What are we doing? What are we doing? We've got like 8 minutes. Um. This is a little girl who was recognised as having reactive attachment disorder. She would now probably be described as having secondary psychopathy, or, you know, um, the good news is that it's a whole documentary. She is now doing really well. So she's an adult, got her own kids, completely functional. But it's interesting, severe history of abuse, maltreatment, oh, no, currently in an adoptive family. I don't know why they do the scary horror music. It's not very fair I didn't.

SPEAKER 5
Are people afraid of you, Beth? Who's afraid of you, Ben? John, Your brother. And what is your brother? Why is your brother afraid of you? OK. And At nighttime, what do your parents do to your door? Why do they lock it shut? Because they don't want me to hurt John. Right, and they're kind of afraid of Of hurting John, are you hurting? OK. Are they afraid that you might hurt them? Yeah Would you, Beth? When would you do it? OK, why would you do nighttime? Because I don't like them seeing me. But they can tell me. And what would you do to him, Beth? That What would you stab him with a knife.

SPEAKER 0
Casey, I mean, you could see the kind of bizarreness compared to those kids of that age, right, in many, many, the way she's talking in the matter of factness, um. And it's that it's that kind of behaviours are very much psychopathy, very behaviours of, you know, willingly hurting other people. However, in this scenario, this is a very, very severe abuse case, OK? Um, it's really important to remember, because I always get cross about this, is that, um. If you think of this as primary, it's the one I've been spending the whole lecture talking about, yes, predominantly the issue is arguably genetic biological, OK, the way in which the brain functions. However, We just, right, we just saw how heritable, we just saw how heritable CU traits were, right? So if you've got a kid with very high levels of CU traits. What do you think one or both of their parents are like? Yeah, it typically comes down the male lines, so it's much higher proportions in males. So, um. The likelihood, unfortunately, that the dad is a, you know, caring, warm, lovely father is fairly low, right, so basically what you see, you see very high rates of abuse and maltreatment. Yeah. Mm. Oh interesting, um, it's typically higher in in boys anyway. So no one actually knows the exact genetics of it. We don't know, right? We, we don't even know, you know, particularly which processes, which genes are involved. All we know from kind of the more kind of, uh, larger scale studies is it seems to. similar to many things actually it comes soon as to come and go kind of father to son, father to son. It may well be that the daughter carries stuff and it's not expressed. I don't know. I don't know. Um, so basically, what I'm saying is, abuse and maltreatment is still there in primary. It's very, very common to find abuse and maltreatment. Just because it's there doesn't mean it's causal of anything. A really important point. It doesn't mean that someone's responding to that. Whereas in secondary, it seems that that's more of a causal process. OK? Three take-home messages. I'm gonna finish on time. My goodness means a miracle. Um, number 1, the development of psychopathy provides a good example of the importance of psychological research. The same treatment does not work for all kids. In terms of antisocial behaviour, and there are clear reasons why that is. Those without high levels of CU traits, versus those that do respond very differently to, um, programmes. Similar behaviours and personality traits can have very different causal pathways. Basically you can't judge a book by its cover, is what I'm saying. Psychopathy is also a hot topic. um, please don't believe anything unless you've read it in a scientific journal. Um, what's the book? Psychopath tests, don't read that book. If you've read it, remove it from your brain. I can't say that. I probably can't say that. I'm sure it's a very interesting read, very interesting read. But I will say this is that the, I belong to a society called the Scientific Society, Wait, hang on, the Society for the Scientific Study of Psychopathy, right? International Society, um, Paul Frick, Robert, all the big names are in it, right? The description of the actual physical description of the people in that book who are researchers in psychopathy is wrong. If the physical description of the people he's talking to is wrong, it's highly likely that what he's saying is wrong. You cannot test someone's psychopathy by a quiz, OK? But you be critical of everything. Finally, it is the most important one. Who will advocate for these kids if not you? OK. These are the kids that you hear about in the news, doing the terrible things, um. Odds are stacked against them in both biology and environment from the very beginning. Think about something like ADHD. 50 years ago we thought these were naughty kids and they got the cane. 50 years ago, 100 years ago, right? Now we know that there's cognitive, very specific cognitive difficulties that are going on. Nobody knows or nobody thinks about cognitive difficulties associated with callous unemotional traits because it's a social disorder. OK, so you have to advocate, and I will get off my little uh talking box and I will let you go. Um, thank you, everybody, I'll see you next week. Last one from me next week.

SPEAKER 1
Thank you, thank you. Yes, go ahead, we can't diagnose some of the psychopathy.

SPEAKER 0
Um, well, not really, in terms, in terms of, um, the way in which it's been talked about.

SPEAKER 1
Good. Oh I know. I've got Tuesday. Of course I had. I Yeah, yeah. Yeah Yeah, and Yeah So So Yes, yeah, but the, the. And then and that's Yeah. Yeah. If you're here for short-term exchange, not exchange, please come down the front, so I don't have to shout. Thank you. We'll start at 3, so there's 2 more minutes.
