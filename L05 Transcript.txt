SPEAKER 0
Yeah. That Alright, everybody.

SPEAKER 1
If you're coming in, can you please shuffle it as quickly and as quietly as possible? Uh, from memory, some, it's a year old memory, but from memory, uh, these lectures are quite tight in terms of timing. That is my memory. I may be wrong. I may have got the wrong lectures in my head, uh, but that is my memory of these lectures, OK? So we're changing, uh, not changing topic completely. We're still in, um, developmental psyche, but we're looking at something slightly different. So the next 3 lectures are on social cognition. OK, so it's like a little mini-series, if you like, of 3 lectures. On social cognition. So don't get rid of the stuff that you've learned about in the last two weeks, keep it in there, um, but we're just changing topics like. So here are your learning outcomes across the social mission mini course, so that's across the next 3. I'm not gonna go through them now, you can read them in your own time. Um, The way we're doing this is, um, in a kind of comparative stance. OK? So one of the main questions that people have in social cognition is, are we as humans, any special, anything different from any other mammals? OK, particularly our closest cousins, the great apes. So, um, in order to kind of answer the question and look at the evidence we have for children and children's social development, social cognition development. We're gonna kind of use a comparative approach. OK, so here's a little intro.

SPEAKER 2
Meet the relatives. You have no noise, hang on.

SPEAKER 1
Uh Do do do Oh, interesting. Hang on. Volume, volume. All right, let's see.

SPEAKER 2
Meet the relatives. These are our closest cousins, the great apes. We like to think we're different. But a few million years ago, we were just the same. Now we dominate the planet. Somehow we humans have left apes far behind. Or have we? Through a series of experiments, we'll prove that apes are much closer to us than anyone thought. Startling images reveal that their instant memory is far superior to ours. Apes can understand hundreds of words. They have a form of language. And they use more complex tools than anyone realised. By looking at the differences and similarities between apes and us, we may find the secret ingredient that makes apes apes and humans human. We take it for granted, but self-recognition is a fundamental building block of human society. We exist as individuals, each with our own unique features. Scientists believe self recognition is essential for our survival. We can live in large groups because we recognise similar features to our own in others. We can tell friend from foe. But is self recognition uniquely human? Show a monkey a mirror and it thinks it's another monkey. It attacks. But how will our closer relatives, the great apes, react when faced with their own image? This 3 year old chimpanzee has never seen a mirror before. He's not sure what to make of it. Erect fur is usually a sign of fear or anger. But his fear is soon replaced by curiosity.

SPEAKER 3
When chimps uh see themselves in mirrors for the first time, they naturally assume it's another chimp the way a human being who's never seen themselves before does and begin to play with the mirror image.

SPEAKER 2
Soon this chimp will know it's looking at itself. Just like these older chimps, they know exactly what mirrors do. This chimp appears to know that that's her tongue and those are her teeth.

SPEAKER 3
Chimpanzees seem to have a concept of the bodily self that allows them to look into a mirror and say that image is equivalent to this body.

SPEAKER 2
But how can we prove that humans and chimpanzees really identify the figure in the mirror as themselves? Psychologists have a well-known test for this. It's called the Mark test. A researcher marks a child's cheek. The child then looks in a mirror. He moves his hand up to the mark. He recognises himself. By the age of 2, half of all children tested can recognise themselves. Soon they all do. So can our ape cousins pass this test? A keeper places a mark on a female orangutan. Next, they put her in front of a mirror. She has seen her reflection before, but this time she notices that something has changed. Her hand goes to the mark. All the great apes, gorillas, orangutans, chimps and bonobos can pass the mark test by a certain age.

SPEAKER 1
So this is the beginning, right? Sorry, background, uh essential reading, essential course reading. So I have often put up things that are recommended. This is required. Um, this is for all three lectures, OK, not just for this one, it's for all three. OK, so they're the only ones you need to read for the next 3 lectures. Um, this is the reason we're asking about self recognition, um, cos it's kind of the first in a building block, if you like, or what appears to be a building block. Now as we go through these next 3 lectures, I want you to think really carefully or keep in your mind the ages that we're talking about when it comes to children. OK, whenever you talk about something as being a building block of social cognition, people assume that it goes A, B, C, D, E, right? It goes in a linear fashion, which is what this kind of, uh, this, this list looks like, right? You're going from something very simple, mirror self recognition, all the way to something like false belief understanding, and they're the things that we're gonna go through over the next 3 lectures. But keep in mind the ages of the children that we're talking about when we look at the ages at which they can demonstrate these skills, OK? So how old are most kids? 50% of kids can pass the self recognition, the Rouge test at age. 2, exactly, right, so by about 3, they should all be passing that test, which means, what that means really is that when they look in the mirror. They understand they have a sense of self. Right, at least a physical self. Yeah, they understand that the thing in the mirror represents the body that they are inside. Yeah. That's actually really important, the self recognition is really important. If you don't recognise the self, how do you recognise the other? Yeah. How do you one recognise or understand that there are entities separate from you? If you do not understand that there is a self to begin with. But kind of more specifically, how do you then recognise individuals? How do you recognise the people that are your circle? Your family, people to be trusted, um, wherein certain skills are developed versus someone that's a stranger or someone that you don't want to be with. OK, so it's multiple layers of social cognition are built upon self recognition. So it includes a physical identity, uh, in order to identify yourself as an individual and therefore helps us in some respect understand our own point of view. OK, this is my body, this is me. I'm an entity in my own right. So when we talk about a theory of mind, um, often when you hear about it on, on TV and stuff, they're talking about the global sense, which is the idea that there's just other people are different from you, and that they have their own thoughts, their own intentions, their own goals, etc. that may be different from your own. OK? And there is some evidence certainly that the great apes, um. Have a broad, a kind of global sense of theory of mind and potentially other species as well. OK? What we're more interested in really is the narrow sense, which we'll look at in actually the third lecture in this series, which is the idea that you can represent yourself as a thinker. Right, and therefore other people are represented as a thinker as well, that kind of internal state is present in all individuals. So, Mirror self recognition, the great apes can do it. Most kids, half kids can do it by the age of 2. So the next thing we're going to look at is empathy, and we've divided empathy into two types. So we've got contagion and we've got helping. OK, so we're interested to see at what age do kids demonstrate. Um, empathic behaviours and what do the great apes do the same thing. So I'll start you off here.

SPEAKER 4
Yeah Yeah. Did she? Yeah Oh, what is that? Oh Oh Can't wake up. Wake up! Yeah, what, what, what the what? Oh my god So while you were watching that, I

SPEAKER 1
was watching you. Um, the reason I do that is because not everyone, it's a huge range, right, but there are certain people in the audience whose face starts to look like his face. OK, you're sitting there going, oh, the sad face came on you, the kind of the furrowed brow, the concern. So that's effectively what we mean by contagion. There's no context there. You can infer the context, it's from a movie. Um, you can infer the context, um, also that kids should get an Oscar, I think, personally. And I was like, far out. Um, but, uh. I haven't given you the context, I haven't given you the broader situation, right? But you are able to um. Effectively resonate with the emotions that are being displayed. OK, so one of the questions is whether this kind of contagion idea, the contagion of emotions, is a building block of empathy. Right, the crime, the requirement to be able to resonate with another person's emotions. There's a lot of us, 1020 years ago now, probably about mirror neurons, and they're certainly they're very interesting. Um, I think there was a moment when we thought they were going to explain a lot of things, and they haven't quite done that, but a mirror neuron, uh, effectively is the kind of neuron that responds when someone else smiles. Mirror neurons fire. Um, and basically produce a cascade of things which make you smile. And some theories going floating around with saying, if I smile, and I feel happy, that's how I know you must also feel happy. So the idea that with these, these mirror neurons were kind of an empathy mechanism, right? They make you copy the emotion of the other person, and then you feel what that is. Right? The theory is not so, it hasn't really gone that far, but um there are certainly systems in place, very basic, uh, neuronal systems in place in the human body that are all to do with resonating with someone else's emotion. You may have heard of this referred to as affective empathy, so in the kind of clinical realm we typically refer to it as affective empathy. Um, it's all about I feel the way you feel, kind of resonate. You don't need to understand why the person feels that way. Right? And that's quite an important distinction between what we'll look at next. Um Which means that you can, this is kind of, it doesn't um you don't need to know the background of the situation, which means. Relationship wise, you may not know the other person very well, right, you can still demonstrate empathy towards a stranger because you recognise the emotions that they're expressing, OK? We bore it. We've got some already, yeah. This is the other really good example that's used in particularly in animal research. It's very effective. I'll do it in a minute. I can't stare at those. They're really close to me, but, um, yawning is incredibly contagious. Even an image of people yawning, even a dog yawning will trigger human beings to yawn. There we go. rippling round, um. This is another form of contagion, look, it's much simpler. If you think about it, if you're trying to do comparative psychology in different species. And you're trying to see whether they have kind of empathy, contagion, the way they express emotions is very different. Yawning is something very simple. Yes, it's not an emotion per se, but it does communicate something, right? Typically I'm tired. You know what else it communicates other than I'm tired? Communicate something else actually as well, less common, yeah. Well, But not bored, no. Similar, yeah. Kind of, yeah, so it's a certain emotion that also triggers it, you know? Um, doesn't communi, well, that's relevant, yes, but there's another actual emotion, yeah. Nope, not cognitive load. That's all that's your good ideas because they're all kind of related to that kind of boredom overly done, yeah. Uh, potentially, so what emotion might it also be triggered in? That's another one. It's a weird one. No anger, pretty similar, yeah. Kind of more specific. More Fear and anxiety People want you all when they're an anxious. You never had that when you're about to do a presentation and you're like. And you just yawn all the time, um. Possibly trying to get oxygen, yeah, yeah. I'm not, I'm not, to be honest, I'm not exactly sure what the purpose of that is, whether it is a kind of primal thing that you're kind of, yeah, you're kind of priming yourself for fight or flight. Um, So this study now, look, we know that humans do that. I've just demonstrated that in the room. So we know that it's contagious, but what if we asked if chimpanzees do the same kind of building block of empathy as well? So this study was incredibly simple. Um, it showed, uh, chimpanzees. So these are semi-free ranging, which means that they are very used to human beings, but they also have kind of, uh, free-ranging area to, to live in. But they're used for multiple, you know, psychological experiments. Um, the study showed them videos of certain things yawning, right? So they showed them a video of a familiar human. So that's someone that they knew. When it says strange human, they don't mean a strange-looking human. They just mean a human that they don't know, right? An unfamiliar human. And then a Glada baboon as well, for different species. And all they were asking was, um, Does the rate of yawning increase when they show them a clip that contains someone else yawning versus when there's a kind of controls, so there's, there's not yawning. OK. So they're looking at the difference. The white bars here are controls, and the black bars here are the videos with the yawning happening, OK? And what you see straight away is that for both the familiar human and the strange or unfamiliar human, um, chimpanzees, yeah, they demonstrate this kind of contagious yawning. So they yawn significantly more in all these people are still yawning. They yawn significantly more, um, when watching, uh, videos with, with the human yawning. OK? So there's a cross-species, if you like, contagion going on. Um, Noticeably they don't do it. When it's a galada baboon. Now someone else has kind of mentioned this before, two of you have mentioned something important here. Um, if you're skipping ahead in the slides, don't do it because it's not helpful to you or anyone else, OK? Obviously you can if you want to, um, but. You learn better if it's kind of a surprise or you have to think on your feet, OK? So, for those of you who haven't skipped forward, why might There not be contagious yawning to a gala of a boon. Yeah. It's to do with that. Yeah, it's not quite the closeness, it's something else. So these are semi-free ranging chimpanzees, they're very used to humans, yeah. Yeah, potentially it's not just similarity, it's something else, yeah. Yeah, potentially, it could, yeah, it could be the actual yawn itself, absolutely. Um, do you know what happens in the wild between chimpanzees and baboons? Are they friends? No, they're not friends, ba boots are terrifying, we've seen ba boots. That they actually really scare me. um. Like they're massive, massively, um. This is the point, right, even though the humans, the strange humans are unfamiliar, these chimpanzees have never experienced an aggressive or anti-social human. OK, they've only had good interactions with humans generally getting, you know, treats and rewards and stuff. In, in contrast, the gelada baboon is an unknown species that kind of evolutionarily they're known to, you know, uh, not like. OK? So the point here is that the um. It is a social process. It's not just a process of um perfect copying, it's also a social process. They have to be comfortable in the presence of the other person in order for that, this thing to happen, OK? The same way as if you were out walking on the street, right? And someone came up to you to mug you, if they happen to yawn, you're not gonna yawn back. Right, it's not, it's the brain's not in that state, yeah. So this is kind of further um. Further information really, so they're kind of extending the results here. Because they wanted to test that idea that it was kind of the social connectedness that made the difference with the Glada baboons. So now they included a group of in-group chimpanzees, so people in the same, uh, chimpanzee group and out-group chimpanzees. The ones that aren't in their groups, so different ones, stranger ones. Um, and now what you see is that the Y axis is slightly changed. So it's the corrected yawning rate. So it's the yawn sessions minus the controls. Right? So the higher the bar, the bigger the difference between in the yawns video versus the control video. Um, and what you see is that, yes, same result for in-group chimpanzees. Right, so the contagious yawning occurs when the chimpanzees are in the in-group. Contagious yawning does not occur when the chimpanzees are in the out-group. In other words, they're seen as a threat. OK. So it's a social mechanism you see in wolves as well. um, so lots of species demonstrate this kind of uh social mechanism, but it's just not very sophisticated. It's definitely social, we can show that it's a social mechanism. Because it's limited by context, but it's not hugely sophisticated as it when it comes to social cognition. That's why it's at the beginning of our list here. So that's contagion or affect of empathy. Now we're moving on to helping, which kind of requires something different, kind of empathy to cognitive empathy. So the issue, in other words with affective empathy is the response tends to be a mirror of the other. Right? So as you did in that video, the kid was crying, your face displays a sad face or a concerned face sometimes. That's not overly helpful sometimes, OK? It's, it could be nice, you know, you resonate with another person, but it's not necessarily the most useful thing. Here's an example of this, OK? Um, you may have been in this situation. So, you know, if you're, if you're in a class situation and someone has to do a presentation, right? Generally, no one likes doing them. If you do, great. It's unusual. People don't like doing presentations, they get nervous, they get sexual anxiety, etc. If you've ever been in a situation where someone is doing a talk, right now, it could be a student, it could be a professor, whatever, they're doing a talk and you can see that they're really nervous, right? If you can see that they're kind of hating it and something goes wrong. It's the worst situation ever, because the person presenting you know, you know they're just panicking, right, you know they feel awful, right? But imagine that's your friend, right, or someone in your group. If you're in the audience, what does your face do? Does your face do this? Right, which is their face. Do you mimic their face? No, what do you do? Maybe laugh, maybe, or relieve the tension. We'll go with that one. Yeah, go on. You smile, do this. Yeah, you do the full, it's going great, don't worry about it, it's cool, keep going. pace. That's the appropriate response in that situation. Yeah? You're not responding with the same emotion, you're responding with a with an emotion that demonstrates you understand their situation and what they're feeling. And also understands that their sense of their state is different from your own. Right. The effect of empathy one is almost kind of more automatic, it just kind of happens. You do it when you're watching a movie, right? Have you been watching a movie, you suddenly realise your face is contorting. It's because you're kind of going into this affective state, you have to be kind of aware of it, um, to do something different. So in other words, in cognitive empathy, the response tends to be more in line with um. What would be useful or, you know, obviously it can also include things that are not useful, like, cognitive empathy includes the negative. Like you need cognitive empathy in order to be a very nasty person. Right, you have to understand what somebody needs and then do the opposite. Right, you have to understand what would make someone hurt the most. And so that requires cognitive empath. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. In the is crying useful when someone else is crying? Why? Uh-huh. That Yeah, no, they. Yeah, there's certainly an element to which you're demonstrating a kind of sensitivity, right? So demonstrating an emotion that is either in line with or responding to is certainly probably in a social situation better than either no emotion, or, you know, dismissing or doing something like that, or trying to fix the problem, which is more of a cognitive approach, I would say, yeah. But there'll be some situations where it's not helpful, you know, if someone is very scared, for example. You demonstrating a similar fear. It, yeah, it might make them feel great, I'm not alone, but it doesn't help the situation. So I think it might in some respects depend on one the uh social context, and two, the actual emotion being displayed. Happy is easy, right? If someone's happy, yeah, you show happy. Right, cause that, that, they, they align, right, the cognitive response and the affective response are actually in the same, they're aligned, right? So you people get that right often. Um, it becomes more complicated when the emotions become more complex, I would say. OK, so the question now becomes, how do we look at cognitive empathy in young children and chimpanzees. So the way this is typically done is actually by looking at helping behaviours or altruism. The theory being here is that they're looking at the kind of cognitive side, right? So they're not, uh, obviously, with chimpanzees, the way they express emotions is very different, um, from humans, often difficult to actually interpret. So they're looking at the actual behavioural response to see if, um, effectively, if chimpanzees and young children will help someone else without personal gain. Right? This is the, this is the kind of uh paradigm that's used to look into this question. So, um. You can read that in your own time, give you a background of what we're about to go through now, OK? So I'll show you this, this is the um. This is the paradigm here. The video here is a little chimpanzee video. Here's what's gonna happen, OK? There are a few different conditions, but basically, the chimpanzee, um, is behind a kind of cage, and it sees two humans tussling over a stick. Like, they're just fighting over a stick. Um, one of them then takes the stick. Um, and either puts it, and put it somewhere out of the human's reach in this example we're about to see. The human then quite clearly In one condition reaches for the stick, OK? So, reaching communicates a desire. Yeah, if they don't reach. That suggests they don't want the stick. Right, so it's a very important, um, part of the experiment is whether they reach or not in the one we're gonna see they're reaching. um, and then they look to see whether the chimpanzees return the stick to the person that was taking it from or not. The reason they fight over it is to give the stick kind of value. Right? If it was a bit of banana, the chimpanzee might go and get it anyway cos they like banana. So it has to be something that isn't intrinsically valuable to the chimpanzee, but they give it that value by fighting over it, OK? OK, so let me walk on one sec. So here's the chimpanzee here that in the inside. OK, the guy here is actually sitting, if you imagine this video went further, he's right here. OK, you'll see his arm in a minute. OK? So he, there he is there, he's the one of the experimenters, the chimpanzee is there in here. I don't know. you Waiting for chimpanzees to kind of come, come back here and I see, I think.

SPEAKER 0
So that's a big.

SPEAKER 1
And OK, so that's 11 of the conditions. There's reaching behaviour, obviously a lot of getting attention. um. Looking to see whether it gives the stick back. OK. So some of the questions that um need to be answered in order to demonstrate that there is kind of cooperative empathy going on here is, um, first of all, is the helping intentional? Right, in other words, is the chimpanzee just randomly picking up a stick? And waving it around and happens to give it back, or are they doing it because they realise that that's what the human wants? Um, The other question that needs to be addressed is whether the reaching behaviour is associated with reward or not. OK? In other words, if the chimpanzees are only really returning the stick in conditions where they're rewarded for doing so, then it becomes just a trick, right? It just becomes like another kind of trick that they're trained to do. Um, Without demonstrating that they are doing it for the purposes of helping another person. The final one that becomes a bit of a tricky one to overcome is the issue of hierarchical bonds. So in uh kind of chimpanzee groups, um. Hierarchical bonds are a very powerful force, right? So chimpanzees may, you know, do things in order to get delayed reward or reciprocation later on from a different member of the group. Um, so that's something that has to be addressed as well, OK? So I'm gonna show you how they've addressed these issues with the experiments that they've done. So first of all, these are the results, OK? So, chimpanzees are in grey, human children are in black. Now we're not so bothered about the differences between the two because they're different species. We're more looking at the differences between conditions. So the first thing I want to show you, and this is the mean percentage, the mean percentage of trials with the target behaviour, which is handing that bar back to the, to the person. On the bottom here we've got reaching versus no reaching. So that's whether the experimenter reached or not. We saw in the video he reached, in other videos he doesn't reach. I'll show you in a second. First thing you should notice is that overall, for everybody, so all chimpanzees and human children, the number, mean percentage of trials with the target behaviour was significantly higher when there was reaching behaviour versus when there wasn't. OK? So it seems to be intentional helping. They're doing, they're giving it back more when it looks like the person wants it more. OK? First thing. And the second thing is to do with, um, reward versus no reward. OK? So. If you look at the differences between, um, it's hard because you've got two conditions going on here. Uh oh, sorry, um. They're still doing the behaviour, as long as the participant is experimenter is reaching, both human children and chimpanzees are still doing the behaviour even in the absence of reward. OK, so this difference is not significantly different from this one. Yeah. It doesn't seem to make a significant difference whether they are rewarded or not. In the no reaching condition, this one is very, very small. That's very little, um, in the no reward, no reaching condition, the chimpanzees aren't doing much. Right? But overall, the, if you kind of collapse across reaching and no reaching. Um, the results showed that whether there was reward or not didn't matter. OK, they're still giving it back. Yeah. Human reaching, yeah, yeah, yeah, reaching. Yes, exactly. So when they looking like they want it, basically, so to speak, um, OK, so. The results they have so far suggest that the helping seems intentional because they're doing it more when the experiment is reaching for that stick. Is the reaching associated with, as in is the chimpanzee behaviour associated with reward? No, both children and chimpanzees give the item back when the adult seems to be reaching for it, OK? not dependent on whether they get rewarded for that behaviour or not, it's more dependent on the reaching behaviour. But have that tricky question again could there be a non-tangible reward for helping? Is there some kind of delayed reward, delayed hierarchical situation that they're expecting, you know, these are humans that they work with a lot. The concern is that maybe they think if they do something good for the human, they'll get something back later on, as per the species' behaviour. So we'll come back to that in a minute. um. In terms of hierarchical bonds, specifically with um Kind of reciprocation in terms of human interaction. The way they control this is they did the experiment again with non-familiar humans. OK, so the best way of controlling for this was saying, well, do they do the same behaviour if it's a non-familiar human reaching? Someone that they're not gonna see, you haven't seen before, have no relationship with, have no kind of hierarchical, um, bonds with. OK? This is another video of, this is a slightly different condition. So I believe the stick is further away and I don't think there's reaching behaviour, so watch, I don't think the person will reach, and I think in this video the chimpanzee gives it back anyway. OK, let's have a look. bit of a tough one.

SPEAKER 0
6 up out Well that have Now he's not reaching,

SPEAKER 1
and now, OK. Not doing it at all. Not reaching until it's given to him. That's just a different one of the other conditions, OK? Um, This question kind of comes up um continuously in chimpanzee research, which is the issue of the fact that they're not doing it within species, right, the experimenter is human, the chimpanzee is not, as I'll show you throughout this uh lecture and the next one. There are ways in which you can come over, overcome that. Um, so there's the question of whether they're acting in the kind of their own interests. Was um overcome in this experiment by actually doing an experiment with another chimpanzee. So this is very cool, it's a very simple experiment. I'll take a bit of time to just explain what's going on here. So they wanted to get rid of the human experimenter, right? They wanted to see if chimpanzees would demonstrate cognitive empathy, altruistic helping behaviour to another chimpanzee. So what they did is this, right? So this is a kind of plan from above, these are 4 rooms. Um, in the recipient room that are represents a chimpanzee, recipient chimpanzee, OK? In the subject room, that's a subject chimpanzees, we're interested in the behaviour of this subject chimpanzee in two different conditions. OK. Here we have two doors, OK, distractor door and target door, and each door is, um, pegged shut, attached by a chain. OK? And the peg is on the other side of the wall. So the chimpanzee in the recipient room cannot reach the pegs. OK? So that they cannot open that door. However, The subject chimpanzee can reach this pick. OK, so they can open this door. They can't reach this pig, they can't open this door. Now the kind of experiment is this, the in either the target room or the distractor room, there'll be some food. Might so imagine a bit of banana in the target room. Or in the distractor room what they want to see is whether the subject chimpanzee. Opens the door more, i helps the other chimpanzee get some food, not their own, not themselves, but helps the other chimpanzee get some food. More, so undo the peg more when the food's in here than when it's in here. Right, Obviously, if the food is in here, there's absolutely no point in undoing that pick. Right, that's the control condition. So if it just likes playing with the peg and opening the door, right, it'll do it all the time regardless of condition. They want to see whether it opens it more when it's in the target room. Does that make sense? Yeah, I'll show you a video now. Right, hang on. This is the recipient chimpanzee's trying to open the door. There's food in here just by that little uh tyre there. And in a minute, you'll see the subject chimpanzee come in. You can't open the door. It wants I And it goes against the banana. OK, so in that condition, what we saw was the subject chimpanzee basically allowing the other chimpanzee to open the door and get the reward. Um And the answer quite simply is yes. OK, they do do it more. I got a graph, yeah, um. They They do demonstrate their altruistic behaviour. OK, so they are, they will have a significantly higher chance of opening the peg when the food is in the target room than when the food is in the distractor. So they demon that's the way they're demonstrating cognitive empathy, altruistic behaviour within species. So what about children? It's kind of, this is a cute one. this is in German, if anyone's got really good German, you'll know exactly what they say. Mine is basic, uh, but basically they're, they're, they're, they're pretending that they are um. The lady is experimenter is pretending that she's writing in a writing a letter and then she drops her pen. OK? That's what happens. But think about the same conditions, right? It's their reaching behaviour. Right, they're trying to mimic exactly the same experiment. It's they're reaching behaviour, um. Is there kind of clear instruction which would make it not altruistic behaviour? Is there thank you or reward of some kind? OK OK, so I'll answer those questions in a second. I'm. OK, there's experimenter, there's toddler, there's mum. There is toddler. There's toddler River there, OK, so we've got, there's a little toy over here, um, to keep it occupied, OK? Onsva and my Oa pass my elf O that's all. Pen out of reach. It's not, is she? Same with the chimpanzee gives it a little thing.

SPEAKER 0
Hey reaching But no verbal instruction. Hey yeah. Ah, it's it's kind of. And no thank you.

SPEAKER 1
OK. That's one of the weirdest things about doing experiments with kids is sometimes you have to make your own behaviour really weird, right? So it's instinctive to say, you know, thank you. Give me the pen, um, or, you know, do a certain emotional expression, and you, you can't do it. Right? So it's one of the weird things about developmental research is you often feel like you're doing the very odd, odd stuff. So we had a reaching condition. There was no reward. There was no direct instruction. And what you see, that kid was about 15 months, probably. Um, around 1518 months, you're seeing children very easily responding to that kind of cognitive empathy altruistic helping scenario. OK. Now, obviously there's variation. Right, one of my honour students once did a project similar to this, and One of the issues we came across was that, um, there are many, many things that drive behaviour, right? So. They might all be capable of demonstrating altruistic behaviour, cognitive empathy. If your child is really shy. They may not do it. Right, and that's, it's not that they don't want to. They might actually think I don't wanna. I don't want to approach the weird lady. Completely legitimate, right? Um, so there are lots of kind of variables that you have to consider when testing, um. Children, um, that you might not consider when you're testing chimpanzees, right, chimpanzees have different, um, problems. But now we're gonna have a quick quiz question. So find your canvas. For the canvas. So I noticed, I think, hang on, yeah, it's right, 98% of people had put the correct letter in last week. Now either the remaining 2% weren't here and we're just trying to go for it. Credit, um, when it's due, but, um, the, if you're sitting here and you didn't realise you have to wait for the right answer before you put it in. OK, we can't correct things afterwards because it time's out. Is everybody ready? No? OK. I'll read it out while you find your canvas. Which of the following would meet the criteria for altruistic behaviour according to the standards set by the chimpanzee research? A Am reaches for her 2 year old's hand when crossing the road, and he runs to grab it. B A plumber is fixing the washing machine and a toddler picks up his tools to help him. C. A dog wants you to throw its ball, so she picks it up and puts it closer to you where you can reach it more easily. A lady drops her fork on the floor while eating dinner at a restaurant and strains to reach it. A passing toddler picks it up and hands it to her. Dad tells his kids that if they helped him tidy the living room, he will give them each $2. OK, are you ready now? Ready? OK. Blind folks, eyes shut. Who reckons a mum reaches for her two year old's hand when crossing the road and he runs to grab it. He reckons, a plumber is fixing the washing machine and a toddler picks up his tools to help him. We reckon C. A dog wants you to throw its balls, so she picks it up and puts it closer to you where you can reach it more easily. He reckons Dee, an old lady drops her fork on the floor while eating dinner. And he reckons E. and dad tells him he tells his kids that they can help him tidy the living room, he will give them each $2. OK, open. Well done, most everybody. So I try to. Uh, trick you with this one, OK, with the word help. So a plumber is fixing the washing machine and Toddler picks up his tools to help him. It looks like it's helping behaviour, it may not be. Right? If it was one of my kids, they would pick up the tools anyway because they want to play with the tools that the plumber has. Right, and they might go near the plumber, doesn't mean that they're they're understanding the plumber's intention or wants or needs. OK? Same with the dog. Dogs always look like they understand, right? They always do that thing with it. Mine does anyway. Looks at you, looks at the ball, looks at you, looks at the ball, looks at you, looks at the ball, right? And you're, in your mind, you're saying the dog's saying, please, please pick up the ball. I need you to throw the ball, right? There's no actual evidence that that's what they're doing, right? Or understanding that you might be throwing the ball. They're just going, it's my ball, it's my ball, it's my ball, it's my ball, it's my ball. Make it move. OK. So mirror self recognition, empathy, um, as we go through, we'll find that we get longer, we spend longer on each section, OK? So, goals and intentions. Have you seen this before? I used to put it in my 2 years, but I think I take it out now. Did you see this last year, anybody would? Excellent. Perfect. OK. So here is an experiment. Note that we have 6 and 9 month old infants. OK, so already you should be going. Because at 2 years old, only half of them are passing self-recognition. And I'm about to show you an experiment looking at something far more complicated, which is understanding goal-directed action and intentions in 6 and 9 month old infants. OK? So This is called, by the way, the mummy ball baby ball experiment, colloquially it's called the mummy ball baby ball experiment, because what happens is this, there are two groups, right? So they're um habituated to one of two conditions, A or B, right? They don't see both in one condition or the other. In the experimental group, what happens is they're showing, imagine this is a screen, basically, so they're shown a screen, there's a little rectangle that looks a bit like a barrier. Um, there's a big ball and a little ball. And what happens first is that they move around, that's just to show the agency, right? How they move isn't particularly important, it's just showing that the, it looks like the balls have some kind of like animation, right, they have some kind of agency. And then they are shown, and the baby ball moves, moves over the barrier. And moves towards the big ball. In other words, you can say baby ball jumps over the barrier to get to mummy ball. OK? In the control group, the motions of the balls are exactly the same. There's no difference, right, they do the little jiggling around, make it look like they have agency, um. And then once they've kind of got that bit, then they move to the next scene where the ball follows exactly the same action as it did in the experimental group. Critically, the wall's now on the side. OK, so the rectangle that looks like a wall is now over here. Right, so the ball's just randomly jumping. OK. The main difference, right, the important difference is that in this group, the jump can be interpreted as instrumental, its goal directed. OK, it's jumping to get over the wall to get to mummy ball. In the control condition it's just randomly jumping. There's no need to jump. OK. Same in direct thought. OK. Then, um, in the test trial. They either saw um the old action or the new action first, it doesn't really um. Matter which one's first, but um. The most important thing about whether they see this or this is that D, this one, the new action, where it just rolls along the floor can be interpreted as rational. Right, because the obstacle has gone. So here we have an irration now an irrational action is jumping over nothing, but it's the same pathway as before. Yeah. And here we have a rational action, but it's novel. The balls do something new, but it makes sense if you understand that the intention of the ball is to get to mummy ball. Right, so it's one of those experiments where it's, it's about whether they have that knowledge in their head or not, right? Whether they can understand the intention of the ball is to get to mummy ball. So the question was this, in which condition does infants show more attention recovery, i.e. which condition captured their attention more? What do infants typically like looking at? Faces, true, yeah, but what else do they like looking at? Things that are. Unexpected, yes, things that are surprising. They like novelty, right? So they go, oh, that's unexpected, and they look at it more. So that's the familiar action, but it's no longer goal directed. The other one is the unfamiliar action, but it is, it is intentional, right, or it makes sense. So here's the design. So we have 6 month olds and 9 month olds. They are allocated to the experimental group or the control group. And then at test, they see both the old action, jumping, the wall has now gone. So look across, everything's the same for everybody now. The wall has gone, they either see the old action or they see um the new action. And sorry, they both see both, but they either see the old action first or the new action first. You don't need to really worry about whether which one they see first, it's just to balance out the experiment, OK? In the, you'll see in a minute in the results it makes a little bit of a difference, but that's not the important part of the, um, findings, OK? But I'm showing you the whole experiment here anyway. The people in the control control group get exactly the same, um. Test trials as the ones in the experimental group. Here's what they find, right? Well, first of all, let's come back here. So what's the differences have gone from here to here, right, is that an action that was rational. Has now become irrational. OK, whereas this one is rational. OK? So if, and here's the if, if infants can understand the intention. Of an agent, right? Whether it's a human or a bouncy ball doesn't matter. If they can understand the intention. That you might that you might expect them to find this one. More attention capturing. Right? Even though it's not novel, they've seen that before, exactly that motion they've seen before, but it doesn't make sense anymore. Right. If, however, they don't understand the intention of an object, right, they can't understand that something has its own goals, own intentions, it's own wants. Then they should find The uh novel action, more surprising and therefore more interesting. Right, so it all depends on what they understand. So, if you look in the control group, so in the control group, remember the there was no wall to jump over. So the movement was always irrational, it was just randomly jumping. There's really no differences, right, there's very little difference between um. Looking at the looking times of the old action and the new actions, the new action being straight along, old action being job, right? Um, In the experimental group, however, so these are the same age children, in the experimental group, here's where you get that massive result. They spend a lot more time looking at the old action than the new action. Right, so that old familiar movement they spend a lot more time looking at because suddenly it's become irrational. It doesn't make sense. Because they understand that the ball is trying to get to mummy ball, and that's why I jumped over the wall. In oops, in contrast. So that that's that one there, OK? That's, you know I was talking about the old action first. Um, that's where you get the biggest result, just because it's first, and it's, it's kind of fresh. Like, it's not theoretically too important, but that that's the figure there. If you compare that to the 6 month olds. Um Far less of an effect. OK, in fact. Here's what you're 9 months old, you're seeing a big effect of the old action in the experimental group, you're not seeing that at 6 months old. So what that means really is that somewhere between 6 months old and 9 months old. Infants develop the ability. Understand that other things have their own goals and their own intentions. And it sounds crazy, given that they don't get self recognition until 2. But that's what this is showing, right? from their um from their eye gaze, from what they're finding more surprising. It suggests that they understand that the Agency of the ball was rational. There was a reason for it to jump. As soon as it goes away from that rationality, they find it surprising. So to balance this out, you have to go, hey, what about the chimpanzees? Right? Can they demonstrate the same thing? Can they understand that something has its own goals and intentions? Now, I'm a big, big fan of really simple experiments. Because a simple experiment done well is like, That's the goal, right, the more complex something gets tends to be the more dodgy, in my mind, right, I'm sure there are very, very good complex experiments, but simple ones have a certain elegance. This is fantastically simple, right, so this is. Here's what they did, OK? I want to warn you, I had to get this straight out of the paper so I can't change this, but they've got A and B muddled up. It should have been caught out, caught in the proofreading and it wasn't. So, A and B are the other way round, OK, so that's B, this is A. Here's what happened. They basically showed chimpanzees this scenario. A guy came in either. Carrying a bucket of heavy things. And then he used his foot to push a button to turn on a light, OK? Simple. So they either saw that scenario or they saw this scenario, where the guy came in, not carrying anything, but in exactly the same position, so see how it's mimicking the other experiment, exactly the same path, if you like, exactly the same motion. And use his foot to turn on the button. Here, this is rational. He can't turn on the button with his foot, so he's using, sorry, he can't turn on the button with his hand, he's using his foot. Here it's irrational, he's just using his foot, OK? So what they then did is they allowed the chimpanzees to go and interact with those buttons. What do you think the chimpanzees did? In this scenario, how did they turn on the button? With their hands. Right? How did they turn on the button in this scenario? With their, with their foot, right? So that in its own way is demonstrating that they understand intention. Here, they understand that there's the only reason that he used his foot is because his hands are full. Right? So we understood the intention was to turn on the button, doesn't matter how. Whereas in this scenario. There's no reason for him to use his foot. So they infer that you need to use your foot to turn on the button. OK, that his intention was to use his foot to turn on the button. Does that make sense? We'd have to check that actually that multiple chimpanzees, and we'd have to check, I can't remember off the top of my head, it's in the paper in the battletleman. Yeah, you have to check whether it was, um, different buttons, one chimpanzee or different multiple different chimpanzees, one button each. Yeah, we have to check, yeah. No, adult chimps, they're all adult chimps. Yeah. Any other questions? OK, great. That was the end of lecture one. Ooh, 5 minute break. Is that OK? Because we are running tight, thank you.
