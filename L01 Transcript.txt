Alright, that is my cue. That is my cue to begin, and as you hopefully are aware, we have two lectures back to back. Everyone aware of that. Yes, so we're here for 2 hours, right? I will, I always try and do a break in the middle so it won't be 2 hours back to back. There should be a little 10 minute break in the middle so you can get some coffee, etc. OK? Um. First of all, welcome. Hello, this is 30 year uh developmental psychology. And this first lecture is very much an introduction. OK, so there's lots of information, um, very little of which is relevant to your exam or anything like that, but it's just information regarding the course. Also, some of you may have noticed there is a very small uh student. Here today, um, this little guy at the front is my youngest son, Arthur. He is 4, and he was a bit unwell last night, so he was a bit unwell, and we didn't know if it was, uh, gastro or not. We think possibly he may have had too many sugar-free lollies, which contain sorbitol, did they? Yeah, um, which has a laxative effect, quite an effective one. you feeling good? He's feeling good now. So anyway, so I couldn't get any other childcare, so he is here down the front. Hanging out with the, with the iPad. OK. Which will run out, by the way, at some point. Uh, so fingers crossed. Fingers crossed. OK, if you're coming in now, uh, please, you might need to go across a row, find a space in the middle. In future, if we can try and uh move into the middle when we first sit down, that would be great. Thank you. As we said, we do assume it was the sugar-free lollies, but in the off chance that it is a gastro, I suggest you don't sit next to him. See My only recommendation. Thank you. OK, let's begin. If you're coming in, just feel free to come in. There are some spaces down the front, around the edges, you may need to climb over some uh people to get there, but there are lots of spaces around, OK? So welcome to developmental psychology. Let's see if my mouse works. Oh, it does. Excellent. Um, so let's acknowledge the traditional owners of the land. So we're on, um, Gadigal land, so we acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora nation. Um. I tend to find these things get a bit repetitive and therefore lose their um value, but I think one thing that is worth of value saying here is that my lectures in particular, I do um. I really appreciate that traditional way of sharing knowledge, OK, and that kind of story form way of sharing knowledge. So in my lectures, if you want to ask questions, if you want to comment, um. Please feel free to put up your hand and do so while I'm lecturing. OK, I think it tends to make things a little bit more interesting, um, it means that if you've got the question, someone else also has the question. OK, so don't be afraid to ask it. All right, so here are your lecturers. So you've got Micah Goldwater. He's the coordinator for this course. If you have questions about the course, contact him. I just do the first, I lecture the first half, he lectures the second half, but he's the one that has all the information about the course structure, etc. OK? So things like Speon, all that kind of stuff, he's the guy you want to ask. Oh look, that's Arthur. That is Arthur a few years ago. Um, and then you have your, have you already been allocated your tutor groups, you know when that's happening? They don't start this week, they start next week. Yes. OK, so we have uh one long 2 hour lecture every week for 13 weeks here. Face to face. Um, and we have tutorials, again, a 2 hour block, but there's only 10 weeks of those. So you'll see in a minute, you'll see the schedule, um. They're not every week for certain reasons, which I'll show you. So there's one tutorial schedule difference between 3016 and 3916, which is in your canvass thing. OK. OK. So this is your lecture and tutorial schedule. This is on Canvas. So, if you might have noticed, Canvas has changed, and this whole thing is on the front page now. So when you click on, you can actually see what's happening which week. Um, so this should not be a surprise to you. The only thing to really notice is this is that I am your lecturer until week 7. And then you have one single guest lecturer and then you have, uh, Micah for the rest of the course. I do most, or I do all of the kind of social cognitive, moral developmental stuff, and Mica does the more kind of classically cognition, um, developmental cognition stuff. OK. No tutorial this week, um, then you have 4 tutorials in week 6, tutorial 5, that's a tutorial only for those in 3916. And then in week 13, which is tutorial 11, there's a tutorial only for those in 3016. OK, that's the only weird thing, and there's no tutorial the week after the mid-semester break. OK. Spend a little bit of time now talking about assessments in this course. I know look this is horrifically boring, but I have to say it. Otherwise you won't know where to come back to to find it, OK, so. In terms of assessment, there are 4 forms of assessment in this course. The first one is tutorial quizzes. Right? So these are submitted pieces of work. Um, it should take you about 20 minutes to write your answer every week. OK, it may take you longer to read what's required, but it's a 20 minute answer. I'll go into more details about this in a minute. The most important thing to notice is that this is 20% of your mark. And it's not difficult to get full marks here. OK, so there's a 20% kind of. Waiting for you. If you, if you want to take it. Um, Note here that there's a question about if something is a hurdle task. I'll explain what that means in a second, but tutorials, not the quizzes so much, but attendance is a hurdle task. Lecture participation, so there are in lecture participation quizzes. The answer is no assessed, so you don't have to get the answer right, cos we'll go through it in um. In the lecture, OK, it's kind of a blinder vote system. Which I'll explain. Um, but that's worth 5%, so again, easy marks, your essay. Um, is submitted in week 12, it's worth 30%. I want to kind of point out now that the reason we do an essays, so quite a lot of courses do, um, research reports, all that kind of thing. The reason we do an essay is because there's quite a lot of content in this course, which really requires you not only to understand it, but actually to be able to think critically about it, pull it together with other parts of the course and make an argument for or against it. So that's really the skill, if you look at your learning outcomes for this course, um, that's really the, the kind of skill that we're wanting to get across in this course. OK, and that's what the essay will be looking at. And then the final exam, um, 2 hours in-person exam worth 45%. Uh, please note that if you're 3916, so that's the advanced version of this course, your exam's only worth 40%, because there's also a 5% research participation bit. OK? OK, what is a hurdle task? So a hurdle task is a task that you must pass with a certain criteria in order to pass the unit. The reason it's a bit weird is because if you get 90% across all aspects of the course, but you fail a hurdle task, you fail the entire unit. So it's literally a hurdle that you have to get over, right? Otherwise you failed the course. Uh, do not be scared because the hurdle tasks are as follows. You're required to get more than 30% in the in the exam, overall score in the exam, OK? Reason being, if you don't get more than 30% in the in the exam, you can't really ascertain that you've kind of got the content of the course, yet you've understood the content of the course. There's also an exam question which will be related to your essay. OK, so you will need to pass that one specific exam question related to your essay in the exam. OK? So that's a pass, past 50%. I'll explain it a bit more in a minute. Um, with tutorials, you need to attend at least 7 out of the 10 tutorials. OK. Except, of course, if you have special consideration. If you miss 5 and you've got special consideration for 3, all good. Does that make sense? Any questions so far? OK, I'm not gonna read this out loud right now, but um. There are 4 kind of primary learning outcomes for this course. You'll see the first one is very large. And it's pretty much what I was talking about just now when I talked about the essay. So, the idea is we want you to understand the kind of theoretical, philosophical, experimental, methodological um underpinnings of what we're teaching you with regards to, um. Developmental psychology. And when we say demonstrate a deep understanding, that means you're able to talk about them. OK, you're about to be able to explain them, um. Talk about how they support or um undermine certain theories, etc. That's the kind of main one. Number 2 is about experimental design. Number 3 is about using data, um, and kind of to understand and describe them appropriately. And number 4 is, um, understand how developmental psychology has kind of important implications for real world things. So it might be education, it might be social policy, etc. Apparently everyone likes learning outcomes. That's why we've developed them so kind of closely, and that's why each lecture, what you'll now see is a kind of an association with what is the learning outcome for this lecture. Um, if you don't, it's tricky to say about this. I think some people really like having those learning outcomes, so it's very clear, which is great. That's why they're there. Um, if that's not the way you learn, if you understand and learn the content of the course, right, that's also a very efficient way of doing things, right? You're not gonna miss out if you only focus on learning outcomes. Um, it's just to give you a structure, if you know what I mean, to kind of think about what we're looking for in each lecture, what we're looking for in each kind of learning component. OK. What is? So these start um. They start now, but they're for the first tutorial in week 2. OK, so you, you don't have to do anything quite yet. Has anybody checked the schedule um in canvas? Has anybody like clicked on the thing regarding um your readings for your first tutorial? Some people have. OK, great. If you haven't, um, go and check it out. Because what is available already are readings. OK, so there are readings available. The difference between what you might have done before is that you need to do these readings before the tutorial. We're not gonna spend time in the tutorial reading things. It's a complete waste of everybody's time. OK, so you do the readings beforehand. And the quiz, the quiz question that you answer is about the things that you've read. OK, so when you come to the tutorial, you have all that knowledge already then. So the readings for each tutorial are made available the Monday of the week before, so they're available now for next week. On the Friday of that week, so this Friday coming, the quiz question will be released. OK, so then a quiz question whoop will pop up on canvas. You have until Monday at 8 a.m. so you've basically got Friday and the weekend, and very early Monday morning, if you're an early riser, um, to write a response and upload it to the assignment box in Canvas. OK. There's no specific word limit, but we have found before people have written quite a lot, and we're a bit worried that they're spending too much time writing, so around 200 words should be fine. OK. Why are we doing this? Um, mainly because we think it's not a good use of your time to be reading in tutorials. Right? Everyone reads at different speeds. I want everyone to have the chance to read at their own rate, their own speed, and, you know, take that information on in their own way. Um, you know, it leads to better discussion, it leads to better learning outcomes, basically. OK? So it's already available that you can do the readings now. On Friday, that question will come out. You can answer it on Friday or the weekend, um, and make sure you submit before 8:00 a.m. on Monday. The reason the deadline is then is because that's when the first tutorial is. OK? So we have to have the deadline before the first tutorial when we start discussing, um, the readings. So each quiz can gain a maximum of 2 points. You'll either score 01 or 2. You score 0 if you do not provide a response, um, or if it suggests you didn't read the material at all. One reflects that you did read the material and you generally understood it, and 2 is a kind of thoughtfully considered response. So effectively, if you do the reading every week and thoughtfully reflect on it, you should get 20%. So you get 20% of your course grade, um, that way. It's not. 2 marks added up because there were only 18 um possible points, there are 9 quizzes. All right, so it's a kind of proportional thing. If you are unable to complete the quiz one week and you apply and you are granted special consideration. Um, all we do is we just make up your percentage out of the ones that you've done. OK, so if you end up doing 8 quizzes and you've got special consideration for the 9th, then we'll work out your percentage based on the 8 that you've done. Does that make sense? Um, This, just be aware of this one, if special consideration is granted for at least 5 out of the 9 quizzes, i.e., you miss more than you've actually done. We no longer do quizzes, um, and instead we will give you an essay question, um, to answer that's based on everything and all the quizzes across the, um, tutorial of the, of the course. OK? It's much easier to do the quizzes. I do recommend you just kind of keep on, on track of those instead. We will aim for tutorials to be a little bit shorter to make account for the time that you're reading in your own spare time. OK? Sometimes that doesn't happen because we get a bit carried away, but, um, that's the aim. Yep. Oh gosh, um, I mean, it's only probably like between 2 and 4 papers that you'd have read. So you can. Yeah. Um, if it's obvious where it's come from, then I wouldn't it, see what the question says. Yeah, I'm not gonna be marking you on your A well, I'm not marking it, but I'm, no one's gonna mark you on your APA referencing standard. OK? It's more of a, do I understand what's going on. Any other questions? OK. In-person lecture attendance and self-assessment. So we're starting this not in this lecture, uh, but in the next one, which will be in about 45 minutes. Um, to help with the self-assessment throughout the course. Uh, so basically, um, if you've logged in, have you done this already? Did you do this last year for something? 2015 maybe? Yeah, um, so effectively during the lecture you log into Canvas and there's a little page, um, where you'll have listed A, B, C, D, A, B, C, D or E. And then I will show you a question on the board and. What I do is a blind vote. So we look at the question, right, and then you consider it for a bit, and I ask you to shut your eyes and put your hand up when I can shout out A, B, C, D or E, depending on which you think is the right answer. The reason I do a blind vote is because um. It's really important that you actually commit. Right, if you sit there and don't actually put your hand up ever, you've never actually made a choice. Right, cos you could be sitting there going, um, you haven't actually gone, it's definitely I think it's C. Unless you put your hand up, OK? And that's really important because the best thing that can happen is you get it wrong. Why is that the best thing that can happen if you get it wrong? Yes, you learn more. You get it right, you don't learn anything. Right, if you get it wrong then you learn something. And then what we do is I show you the correct answer, and it's the correct answer that you put into Canvas, which means that everyone here will get the correct answer. OK, so do not put anything in canvas until I've shown you the correct answer. That makes sense? OK, good. Research SAA. So this will be released in week 3. so Mao, I think, will probably release this. Um, he's away at the moment, but he'll be back very soon. The other thing we, we give an optional, um, activity, it's entirely optional, you don't have to do it. But if you want to, you can submit an outline of your essay for feedback by Friday's 26th of September, so week eight. Um, that's the date he thinks at the moment. Effectively, it's just to give you a kind of, or tutors will give you an idea of are you along the right lines. Yeah, does it look like you've got a decent idea going on here? And then it will be due on week 12. Uh, late penalties as per usual, so don't make it late because it's not worth that percentage. 2000 words max, within 5%. And it should be based on uh lecture and tutorial material, um, but if you want to, you can supplement it with additional references if you like. OK, this will make much more sense when you get the topic. Why do we do this? Um, for that main reason I said before, um, we both decided that by 3rd year, it's actually really important that you can make an argument, that you can, uh, take data, take information across several different areas, perhaps, and bring it all together to provide support for your argument against other people's arguments. And what that requires is effectively some level of critical thinking, um, and a good uh good skills in terms of communication. OK, written communication. So it kind of cuts across all those learning outcomes that we looked at earlier. Ooh, this what this blurb here, which I won't read out, it's all about AI. OK, so you'll be fully aware that the university is, is, you know. All over the AI stuff, um. So generally there's a kind of ban, university-wide ban, but it is up to the course coordinator, um, what they permit. So, as Mica says, um, it's a new technology, and we're happy for you to learn how to use it. It's very widely available. Um, what we recommend is that you can use it to help you research, right? Use it to help you kind of form first draughts. And when I say first draughts, I mean like skeleton draughts. Yeah, just the outline kind of plan thing. If you want to help you do that, that's absolutely fine. You do need, you need to declare it. There's no penalty in doing that because we've said it's fine, right? But you do need to declare that you've used it. OK. Um, and I think Michael will give you more detailed information about, uh, the kind of restrictions and stuff when he gives you the outline to the essay in week 3. OK? So don't worry too much about it now. Um, one important thing, though, is that, um, you know, I mentioned there's a question in your exam, based on your essay. The reason for this, and the reason you have to pass it is because it's very, very, very well known that if you use AI to write some kind of critical thinking piece, you know it very, very poorly yourself. OK, so you're not gonna pass. If you've written an essay, you're gonna pass that question in your exam. No problem. If you haven't written the essay, you probably aren't. So it's, it's one of those, that's why it's a hurdle task. OK? So one had a question, yeah. Ooh, I don't know. There was, I think last year they may have been because there's a research, research participation component of 391. Um. You'll have to check with Mica. OK, he'll let you know when he's back. Any more questions on this? No, no. Yes. Yeah. The whole thing. The whole thing. It's a lot of it's a lot of pressure, right, but it's like, it's it's like doing honours or a PhD, right, by the time you've thought about something for a long time and written it, you are an expert on it. I think, I think it will be it will be clear from the question, yeah, I I would think so, yeah. Um, it's not something to worry about if you've written an essay on a topic. You can answer a question on that topic. OK, you can. Anything else? Yeah we good. OK. Um, Yeah, the only other thing to be aware of with AI is always do declare it. Again, there's no pen if you've been allowed to use it, there's no penalty in declaring it. The reason I say you do that is because, um, I always hear someone talking about, oh, yeah, the university's got this technology that can, like, find out if you're using AI. But my friend told me they've got this technology that can, like, beat the university's technology. The university's not telling you what technology they're using. They're not telling you. OK, so the ones that they say they're using, I'm sure they are, I'm sure they're using multiple others as well, right, because obviously it's a massive issue in, in, uh, further education. Alright. Oh To our examination, um, obviously it is, it is compulsory, it is a, uh, Combination of multiple choice and short answer questions, it's in person, as I said before, it's a hurdle task, so you need to get more than 30% overall and to pass that essay related question. It's based on Um, lecture content. And set readings. So look, there are loads of readings on this course. Many of them are recommended, they're not required. There's a very clear distinction between the two. If something is a required reading, what we mean is that there's stuff in there that we want you to know that we don't have time to do it in a lecture, right? But we want you to know the content of that paper. If it's recommended, then what we mean is if you're interested in this topic and you want to understand it a bit more, read this paper. OK? This will help you understand, for example. So just be clear in that distinction. Um, The material from tutorial classes may supplement your answers, so you can always use that kind of information in your essay responses, um, but you didn't have to re-study it for the exam. OK, there are no specific questions on just the tutorial content. OK? Um, I had another question, what was it, something about that, hang on. Oh, yes, um. The other thing, and again, I'm gonna harp on about the kind of point of this course being about, uh, being able to communicate ideas. We tend to find when it comes to the exam and the short answer questions, um, every year student, you know, every year students will um. Make this one mistake, which is they see, they see it, uh, uh, essay, they see a sorry, they see an exam question, short answer exam question, and they see the topic, right? And then they just write down everything they know about that topic, which can be loads. They don't read the question. OK, it's really, really important in this course. It's a, it's a kind of deep thinking course. OK, read the question in the exam. Thanks, give you exam tips already. OK, ooh, more tips, OK, um. When it comes to reading, um. OK, go on. Yeah. Material from tutorial. Not directly, no, it may be that the things that you've read and the things that you've discussed in tutorials can supplement your answer, which is absolutely fine. Yeah, so you can use that information, it won't be required in order to answer that question. We're not gonna ask you something specifically only talked about in the tutorial. OK. Ns? OK. Um, It's a really tricky area of developmental psychology because um there's loads of loads of media regarding it all the time. So not just uh mainstream media, there's loads of social media. Loads of it is total utter rubbish. And I really, it's a real problem, and I get really cross about it, and I do a special fields course in honours all about it, right? Because they're so popular. Kids, families, clinical psychology, they're all super popular areas. Um, and yet the amount of stuff that you're exposed to that is absolute rubbish, even by people who look like they're really, really, uh, qualified, people who say they're really, really qualified, and it's just complete rubbish. OK, so be careful with what you read. There's no harm in reading widely, right? It's good to read a vast array of different opinions, etc. Just be very careful about what the source is, OK? Um, read what we recommend, if you're interested, if it helps you understand, because that's why it's there. Um, and try and get quality stuff. Now, you can't always tell the quality of a journal article from the journal itself, but generally, it's a good start to read something from a peer-reviewed journal rather than from, you know, Mamma Mia magazine, for example, which is the big one on parenting. Not saying that it's necessarily bad. Just in general, OK, in terms of thinking. Critically, broadly and creatively on this course. OK, one thing that's hard to realise sometimes is by the time you get to 3rd year, you're kind of on the edge anyway. You're on the edge of what we understand. So sometimes some of the things that I'm going to teach you about in this course, there is no answer to. I'm gonna leave you open ended. Right, because there isn't an answer yet. Um, explains it's really important, particularly for the essay and for the exam. Um, your ability to communicate things is really important. So I have two major tips. The first one, don't be a bad food critic. So what we tend to find in across, you know, all people is that when you don't understand something, you rely on jargon. OK, when you don't understand something, you rely on flowery language. Cause it's easier. It's very hard to explain things in simple words. So think about those food critics that are like, Oh, the iridescent effervescence, blah. And you're like, that sounds lovely. But then someone else will go, Oh, I love the way the pepper and the mint combined to make that really tangy flavour. You're like, OK, I get you. Right? The difference. One's using flowery jargon, the other one's actually explaining what's going on. Do be a good Pilates instructor. Right? My other example here, it's been a very long time since I did any Pilates, but I did do it once, and, um, the reason I did it was because the instructor was amazing. Amazing in that for a complete beginner like me, I knew exactly what I needed to do from what she said. I didn't need to do that awful thing where you're trying to lie on the floor there, but also strain your neck to see what the person's doing, right? That wasn't required because her ability to communicate exactly what I needed to be doing was so good. OK? So keep those things in your mind. Oh, OK. So, move on a little bit, just to a general, let's look at what developmental psychology is. Some of you might be here thinking, not sure whether I made the right choice. Like, I don't really want to work with kids. I'm sure they're cute and everything, but you. Um, but I don't, it's not really what I want to do, OK? Fear not, uh, because it's very many things. OK? So it's kind of social aspects, educational aspects, motor development, um, psychopathology, biology. So let's look at some things that we can consider it as being, OK? When we think about um development, something that is really important is the rate of change. I'll give you some examples here. So this is a graph. Of the human height growth per month. And it's just heights, right, nothing particularly interesting, but there are two interesting parts of this curve, right? Number one interesting part is between 0 and 3, because the rate, which is the higher higher ends up here, the faster the growth. OK, so between 0 and 3 we've got massive amounts of growth, and what's this over here? Yes, puberty, adolescence rights is the growth burts of puberty. So There are certain times when things change pattern or where they develop quite quickly. Look at something like vocabulary. OK? You've got sharper increases declining as you get older, right? It happens again in childhood. If you take something as extreme as its executive function, between the ages of 4 and 5, it's like that, um, between the ages of 4 and 5, it's almost a straight line in terms of executive function, planning, forward thinking, managing, you know? That kind of that kind of acceleration. What does that mean if you were interested in executive function, why might you be interested in in having a cohort of 3 year olds and six-year-olds? Yeah. So your 3 year olds are down here. Uh, 6-year-olds are up here. So you should see massive differences. If you followed on a group of kids across 12 months, even from 4 to 5, you should see those things develop. Right? So you get much more of an insight into the development of a certain thing if you look at the point in time when it's changing the most. Uh, what else is it? It's very, very multidisciplinary, multidisciplinary, this one. and that's, that's why I like it, really. I don't actually work with kids. I haven't worked with kids in a very long time. Um, but my approach is developmental. So I'm kind of on I'm in this one, I do cognitive science, I do genetics, I do biology, but my kind of philosophical approach is that I'm looking at something that is there from birth. Yeah, so I take that approach. So if you're interested in history on the side, biology, genetics, whatever it is, there's somewhere in developmental psychology that you can fit in, is what I'm saying. There's a place for you. All right, let's look at a major theme throughout the course. This is perhaps most clearly demonstrated um in Mica's course, which is more about cognitive development. Uh, but we do spend quite a lot of time thinking about it online as well. So a major theme here is effectively empiricism versus rationalism, which is more easily thought of as nurture versus nature. I've purposely put them in that order because nurture corresponds with empiricism and nature corresponds with rationalism. OK? This isn't a philosophy course. We're not gonna, you know, go down that route completely, but the idea of nature versus nurture. Is a very, very important question when it comes to child development. To keep that kind of, there are a few things I want you to keep in your head as you go through this course, and I want you to keep coming. I'll try and prompt you, but it's good to keep trying to come back and think about it in this kind of broader picture, OK. So we look at a range of things, so language, cognition, intelligence, personality, um. The question of whether nurture or nature is at play kind of varies in its um significance depending on whether you're talking about a personality trait or something like IQ. OK, people respond differently. To the question of nature versus nurture depending on what you're talking about. So as these little uh pictures can er show to you, there's a, it's been recognised for a really long time by very many people. That childhood is a period of life where just things have a quite a dramatic effect. OK? The things that um Happen or develop or change between the ages of, say, 0 and 6 are far more influential than the things that happen between the ages of 30 and 36, for example. OK, so we're looking at a very kind of interesting time. Overall. Um, and the significance of that can be seen in these quotes, right? People genuinely consider what should be done, how what's the best way to raise a small child. Um, you know, should they be allowed, should they be playing only? Should they be learning? All these kind of bigger questions come up when we talk about early childhood. But there's also a lot of um confusion, right, people don't, lots of people make these kind of comments without really having an understanding of child development very um. Based in a lot of kind of empirical research, right? You see it in parenting trends, so that's all over the news at the moment, all these different parenting trends. Um, and something that always bothers me is you have to come back to what is developmentally appropriate for the child. And most people, not most, can't say that, many people talking about this kind of parenting style things don't have that background. Right, they're going with gut gut, um, feeling, intuition, what they think is right, um. The really classic one you get is, um, which has nothing to do with parenting styles, but you see it all the time for very tired, uh, worn out parents with say a 12 months, 18 month old, right? And it'll be something like, you know, they'll say to you that, you know, they looked at me. And they made eye contact with me, and then they like, you know, threw their bowl of food off the floor and the parent will go and I knew, I knew he was just doing it to piss me off. Right, and you know where they're coming from, right, because they are exhausted and they're like the little kid was like yay, um, but they can't do that. They weren't doing it to piss you off, they have no understanding that that's the kind of implication of their action because they don't see you as a body with an independent mind, independent from themselves. Right? Completely impossible that that's what they're doing. And it seems like a facile example, but what you see in things like conduct problems and in parenting dynamics and stuff is you can get parents who attribute those kind of things to their children when it's completely inappropriate to do so. Right, and they start thinking that their child is naughty or. Impulsive or blah blah blah blah blah. Um, and it's because they're not aware of the developmental stages of the child. OK. So there are 4 things you want not just 4, there are many things, but. In terms of your journey through this course, I want you to consider what you think is most um relevant to you. Do you think this will be interesting because you think of it as a kind of theoretical commitment, right, that you think development is an important process, um, that you think early childhood is an important process that needs to be, um, committed to in terms of, you know, funding policy, etc. Are you interested in certain other parts of psychology or human development and you want to use childhood as a as a kind of window or a tool to investigate those processes? OK. Any of these options is fine. Right? If you're just, if you're interested in children themselves, right? And how they develop and what their world is like, again, Perfectly um You know, you're in the perfect place to do that as well, OK? So what I'm trying to say is find your own angle that you find really interesting. Look at it, look at it through that angle. Oh yeah. So in some of my, not all of my lectures, but in some of my lectures, um, I have something called Points to Consider, um. As they look like this. Look, there you go. That's a point to consider. So, I don't answer those questions in the lecture, or even after the lecture. They're purely there to help you think about things in a slightly wider context. OK? They can help with revision if you want. It's always good to kind of chat them through with a friend, um, talk about it, kind of have a back and forth. So, for example, for what we've talked about so far, I might say, is developmental psychology simply the study of change? Right? Just there to make you have a little think about the answer. Um, also, It's, we come back to this slightly more so my, I think it's my final lecture. I will have a bit of a chat with you about um careers and where you're going, but. For now, um. It's worth having a little think, right? Because if you don't know what you're doing, um, I know some of you will be wanting to do the clinical masters, um, some of you will be wanting to kind of work with, uh, children and adolescents, maybe in different ways. So it could be education, it could be social work, it could be forensics, whatever. Many of you may be, um, wanted to be parents. When you're older, some of you will be parents already, right? So it's relevant for you somehow. OK, that's what I want you to find is the relevance for you. Oh gosh, OK. So we now have many slides about emergency procedures and things, which I will go through fairly quickly. We actually just had one. If you didn't get here, if you were here early, we had like a little uh exciting alarm, er. Drill practise, which thankfully stopped. Um, but if there is an emergency, we need to evacuate. There you go, green men, follow the green men, um, and we to get far away from the building. OK, I will get you all out. Um, if you're sick, uh, apply for special consideration, don't come in or wear a face mask, it's fine. Um, oh, this is actually quite important because some of you missed out on all of this, um. I don't know if you know, but I'm the academic lead for student life at the School of Psychology, which sounds like I organise parties. Um, it's not just about that, it's more about your experience of undergrad. And there are people who reach 30 year who haven't found their people yet. OK? They still feel kind of isolated and alone. There are places you can go, right? So you can go to Student Life Well-being and Sport page. Um, there's also the Welcome hub. You don't have to be new. You can go there whenever you want. Um, and they have resources there as well. OK, that you might find useful. I'm gonna take a little moment just to say, we had, I think it was, when was it last year, 2 years ago, I can't remember when, but continuously we have issues with um our students being targeted by scammers. Um, but in person, online, through your email, phone, um, everyone thinks it's the old people, like the older age people who are the most vulnerable to scammers. It's actually you guys, you are the most targeted and most, um, affected by scammers. Sorry. Um. So it's really, really important, especially they also target international students more. So if you are an international student, please be, please be very, very aware. Don't do anything with any money, don't send any money anywhere. Don't give anyone any information until you're talking to someone in person. And if you're not sure, you can actually ask student wellbeing. They'll, they'll tell you. OK, go in and talk to them. OK? I know it sounds like it's not gonna happen to you, but it was happening to our students fairly recently. OK. Uh, we also have a safer Communities office. OK, so this is all just provided in those slides so you can find them at a later date. So if you're experiencing anything along these lines, so sexual misconduct, family violence, bullying, harassment, it doesn't just need to be in the university context. It could be outside university context. Um, this is the team you want to contact. OK, so there are things providing support for you. Um, in terms of academic integrity, again, I always say this, and it sounds like, I'm sure you're sitting there thinking, like, when does this ever happen? Every year this comes up. OK, every year across every cohort, we have an issue with academic integrity. So it does happen, um. Don't do it. If you are, you know, if you're freaking out and you're running out of time, or you can't, whatever's happening, which means that you're thinking about either using AI to write your essay or you're cheating or whatever, just come and talk to your tutor or to me or to Mica. OK, just come and say, look. It's not happening and there are, you know, we can look at special consideration, all that kind of stuff instead, OK? Um, When Micah tells you about the essay, I'm gonna just remind him to be really clear about what he accepts for use of AI, OK, cos I want you to be confident in what you can do and what you can't as well. It's not fair for us to say you can use it, but you can't use it to the whole thing if it's not really clear. Oh, OK, great. Is that the one? Good, that's the end of the first one. You may now all breathe. Um, thankfully we've finished about 5 minutes early, so what I'm gonna ask is, do you want to take a 10 minute break now, but come back at 52? Is that good? But some will say no. Yes, no? Why are you saying no? Yes, OK, good. I changed your mind. OK, um, have a break. I'll see you in 10 minutes, OK? You can stay here if you want, it's fine.
