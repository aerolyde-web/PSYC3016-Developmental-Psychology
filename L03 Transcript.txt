Alright everybody, you know what, I'm gonna veto everybody, I'm afraid. I'm afraid my preference one. Sorry everybody, hope you can see. If you're coming in, we are starting now, so please can you as quietly as possible, make your way to a little seat. Thank you very much. There are more seats at the front than there are. Round the back. We are starting everybody. If you're coming in a bit later, it's absolutely fine, just head towards the front. OK, um, for those of you who were in my tutorial, or tutorials yesterday, um, I apologise for not being there. My middle son was having, uh, some surgery. That is why I have another child at the front of the lecture theatre again today. Uh, he's all good, it's all fine, but he can't go back to school till Thursday. OK? He's hopefully gonna hang out. Quietly, we shall see. OK doke, so um. Last time we were here, we did an intro lecture that was mainly boring stuff. And then we had another in in like lecture that was talking more about nature versus nurture and what we meant by that. And the idea that the environmental influences and genetic or biological influences, um, can be very important in interesting ways. So, The two lectures today, um, back to back, lectures 3 and 4 are looking at behavioural genetics. Now, if you have the slides for these already, don't go through them ahead of me. One, because it's annoying, but 2 for me, not for you. Um, it's annoying for me, but also, you actually will learn less. The kind of point is that you go through it in real time. OK? If you don't want to do that, you want to make those, that's, that's totally fine. I'm just saying they're kind of designed to, um, Lead you through them. If you're coming in at the back, come straight down to the front, come straight down to the front, we're expecting a full lecture theatre. Thank you, sorry, didn't mean to single you out, um. Well done, everybody. OK. So, let's just 3, we are looking at, uh, we talked about heritability, what that is, we're going to look at that in a lot more detail. We're gonna understand what twin studies are all about and what we mean by different types of environment. The lecture after that, so after our little 10 minute break. It's going to look at something called the missing heritability problem and what it is. We're gonna look at some interesting interactions and then think about why we care about all this in the first place. So here are your learning outcomes for lecture 3 and lecture 4. I'm not gonna read them out to you, you can read them there. Just to remind you again, when I say understand, I mean uh more than just be able to regurgitate it. OK, understand and really really critically understand it. OK, so let's do a little recap. So we know from last week that all psychological traits or complex human traits, basically, are heritable. Doesn't mean they're entirely based on your DNA, but there is a proportion of variants, if you like, in those traits that is due to genetic factors. OK? So heritability, and we write, tend to write this H squared. Don't ask me why, that's how it's written in H2d. How much of the variation of a trait, which we call a phenotype when we're talking about genetics often in a population is due to genetic differences in that population. And as I said last week, it is an important, um, definition to be able to understand and remember. OK? So heritability is talking about the variation of a trait. How much variance in a trait, um, is due to genetic. Differences. So traits or phenotypes, um. Are you familiar with the word I always kind of explain it, but are you familiar with that word phenotype and genotype? Yeah, OK, OK, good, that's fine, cool. OK. So phenotype is basically the genetic effects or the genetic variation plus the environmental variation, right? We saw that. So let's look at something really simple to really try and understand um what we mean by heritability. If you look at something really simple like height, here we have people lined up in order of their heights, from smallest to largest, um, and what you would expect to see is that kind of bell-shaped curve, right, the normal curve. Well most people are in the middle and you have some people, um, with fewer and fewer getting towards each end. So let's look at a question of, you know, can we use twins, for example, to work out if height is genetically determined. Um, Typically we do this, so your kind of heritability estimates are used er using what's called twin studies. And they are what's called a naturalistic experiment. They're a naturalistic experiment because twins just occur in the population, right, you don't have to create them. Um, they exist. Um, and we have two different types of twins, so we have monozygotic twins, which are identical, and dizygotic twins who are non-identical, so effectively siblings. Yeah, the same genetic relatedness as siblings. Um, what's shown quite neatly in this kind of why they're wearing such big pants, I do not know. But it's confusion. Um, the point they're trying to make here, what point they're showing is that monozygotic twins are incredibly similar in terms of what they're showing you here is physical stature, right? Height, body shape, whereas your dizygotic twins, even though they share the environment, they only share 50% of the genes, right? And they can be very, very different, just like siblings can. So the power of these twin studies um comes from the fact that they are effectively naturalistic experiments. OK, that's where the, the power comes from, um. From this very handy little fact that monozygotic twins share all the genetic information, and dizygotic twins share on average 50% of genetic information, right, with their other, with their other twin. We're all good with that, yes, high school biology stuff. Good. So let's have a look. So here we have um 2. Correlation graphs, basically, where we have, um, twin one's height on the bottom in centimetres. That's the same on both graphs. And on the, um, X axis here, sorry, Y axis here, I always get that confused. We have, um, a twin 2's height. So twin 1, twin 2, basically. So each dot represents 2 people. Yeah, each dot represents height of twin, 2 and the height of twin 1. And we have the correlation between monozygotic twins in height is 0.96, very high correlation. correlation for dizygotic twins is 0.32. So there are two important constructs you need to understand to kind of get the basic logic of twin studies, or at least the basic underlying principles. Number 1 is correlation, #2 is variation. So. When we think of correlation, typically I think now when we think of correlation, we just think of running it through the tables, right, and getting the results of SPSS and seeing what your correlation coefficient is. Um, when we look at it in something like this. It basically refers to the fact that there is some sort of systematic relationship between variable 1 and variable 2, so twin 1 and twin 2. So the cluster of points here um around each line, and it's also worth noting that it is a straight line, right, so we're talking about a linear relationship. There is some kind of structural relationship between the height of one twin and the height of another. Um, so this kind of cloud, if you like, is, uh. The extent to which the closeness of which the points cluster around the best fit line, that's a kind of regression line, right? And what you see is that the tighter these points are around the line, the stronger the correlation. They at least we have a stronger correlation here than we do here where they're all a bit more scattered around. That makes sense? Um, Well that's effectively at the correlation, right? It's how closely do those points land on that line. The closer they are, the stronger the correlation. Variation is something slightly different, which is, um, the way those points are actually distributed over that, um, range, if you like, or over the scale. So what you'll notice is that the range for the monozygotic and the dizygotic twins is pretty similar, right? They're mostly all between 150 and 190. Right? We've got one dot there, a couple of dots here. But that's the range is basically the same. Um, but the The variation is not, and the easiest way to think about this is go back to the normal curve, right? When you have a normal distribution, you have most people in one standard deviation away from the mean, right, 66, 68% in that range. You go another standard deviation and you get about 98% of your entire sample within that range, and then you get fewer and fewer. If you think about it, what happens when you have um In one sample, 2 people that are so highly correlated. What, imagine if one of those people is incredibly short. So they're an outlier, right, they're down here. In fact, they're they're down here, right? What, where's the other twin? Is they're monozygotic? Yes, thank you, down there with them. Right, so rather than here, in this figure over here, if you have some one incredibly short, um, twin, the diyquatic twin is far more likely to be in the normal range, right? But it's because it's more likely to be within the normal. Range or two stone deviations, yeah. Yeah, um, Yeah, to well to match, I would say to match up with the monozygotics you'd have to use same gender, yeah, I would say so. Yeah. Otherwise you're right, you would get a much bigger spread, right? No, so, so this, this is kind of an example. So for this exact study, I have no idea. I have no idea. We, we all get to look at monosychotic twins in different environments a bit later on. OK? Um, basically, the point he's making is that when you have monozygotic twins, variation is not exactly normal, right? Because you, you're more likely to have two extreme points rather than one. Now it's, it's confusing because on these figures, 1 point represents two people. But just remember that that should, that point in this figure might be over here. More within that middle range, right, which it says it's increasing that or decreasing the correlation because it's moving that point, far away from the, from that line there. OK. And these assumptions are kind of made, right, so it's assumed that um. Things like correlation and variation are are fitting certain criteria. When you, when you do any stats model, right, you have those criteria that you're meant to check first. Same with twin studies. Um, whether or not they do always meet that criteria is, is another question, right? But we'll look at the kind of pluses and minuses of twin studies in a bit. So here's just kind of to point out, you can see within the monozygotic twins, not only are the points, if you take, for example, the mean of 170, and then you take a kind of, you know, away from the standard deviation. So away from the mean, 180 to 190, not only the points very more clustered around that line as compared to here where they're, you know, spread out all the way across that rectangle. Um They also, here you can see the variants, right, because they're spreading out into the, because of the lack of relationship, lack of correlation, the spread is much bigger as well, OK, so it's more kind of representative of that normal distribution. OK. So, How do we get this heritability index from using twins? This is the question. So we know we've said before that the variants in the phenotype. Can be explained by variances due to genetic effects, plus the variants due to environmental effects like easy. And we know that the heritability estimate is what we mean. So H2 is what we mean when we talk about the genetic influences on the phenotype. So we can rewrite this little equation as one, so one being like everything. So all the variants, unity, right? All the variants. Is equal to um H2, so the heritability estimate, the genetic influence, plus the environmental effects, E. So we get that little formula right there, 1 equals H2 plus E. So, if we can work out what the environmental influence is, right, the variance due to environmental variables, we can work out what the variance due to genetics is, right, what H2 is. So this is where we go to our twins, we say help. So, you've got your monozygotic twins, your dizygotic twins, they share the same amount of environment, they differ in terms of the genetics that they share. Correct? Oh, this is why you shouldn't skip ahead, otherwise it would be funny. So, it's a little, it's a little bit more complicated. So because there are different types of environments where it gets a little bit confusing. So a common environment, again, these definitions are very useful, OK, the common environment or denoted as C. These are events that happen to both twins, critically influencing them in the same way. OK, that's how they're defined. So basically things are common, right? Things that happen to both twins that have the same impact on both twins. Now it doesn't need to be a dramatic thing, right? It could be. The town they live in. Quite common environment, they both had that. They both had the same impact, right, same on beach twig. Um, Unique environment effects, these are denoted as E, just beware it's not you, it's E. These are either events that occur to one twin but not the other. OK, so clearly unique, but they could also be events that happen to both twins, but they influence them in different ways. Right, so the outcome's different. So for example, if one twin falls off their bike, breaks their leg, that's a unique event for one twin. Something like a death of a parent, for example, that happens to both twins. But it may have a different effect on one twin than the other. Right, it's just an example. Again, something like bullying, they might attend the same school, right, that's a common environmental variable. One of them might be bullied, the other might not. You see, so it gets, it gets quite complicated whether something is a common environmental variable or a unique environmental variable. So the environment in total comprises C + E. OK, common environment plus unique environment. So now we can rewrite our equation to be a little bit more accurate. We can say that the phenotype or the variation in our phenotype is due to variation due to genetic effects, G or H2 plus variation due to common environment, plus variation due to unique environment. So 1 equals H2 + C plus E. And at this point we can now use the twins. OK. So to be clear, monozygotic twins share 100% of their genes and 100% of their common environment, by definition. Yeah. So what we can say is that the correlation. Between identical twins, so the correlation RMZ is denoted as, on whatever trait it is, so take a height example, it provides an estimate of, That genetic influence, plus the common environment influence. Right? Yeah, it's like the extent to which they're the same in something is due to the things that they are the same in. Right, genes and common environment. So we had a correlation of 0.96 in height. In our twins from that figure before. So that correlation of 0.96 is due to H2 plus C. Yeah. So in monozygotic twins. What's left? Must be due to the unique environment. Yeah, that's the only thing left from our equation. So 0.04 or 4% of the variance in height is due to the unique environment. Does it make sense so far? Yes. I always find it really interesting because I often people are typing, like or writing in my lectures. And obviously when I went to lectures, no one had laptops, right? I know it sounds great. But um or at least not in first year, and so there was no writing. Maybe some scribbling with a pencil, but mostly you're just like. And so I always wonder whether like, does it help to write down things, or is it more helpful to not write down things and just concentrate? You know, I once had a guy in my lectures who came in, he was a very cheerful guy, and he came in with a backpack, right? And he was great. And he came with a backpack and he always walked really like, jovially to the front of the lecture hall, and he took out a dictaphone, and he'd always ask the lecturer, personally, you know, do you mind if I, I assumed, do you mind if I record your lectures? And then he put the dictaphone on, he turned it on and then promptly lay down and went to sleep. Every single lecture, and I don't know if he was asleep, but he didn't move. He was just like this. For an entire, it was great it was great. You're welcome to do that if that works for you, just so I'm saying. Sorry, that's an aside, but I always find it interesting. Try different things and see which one works for you. That's what I would do. So where were we? So for monozygotic twins, 4% of the variance in height is due to unique environmental variants, right. Now in dizygotic twins, they share 50% of genes, 100% of common environment, so the correlation between them. Right, so the extent to which they're the same in height is a direct estimate of half. Of genetic things due to genetic variants and all of common environmental variants, OK? So here's some little formula that we have for any given phenotype, the correlation between monozygotic twins equals H2 + C. correlation for dizygotic twins equals 1/2 H2 + C. Now just so you know, in case you're scared, I'm not gonna ask you in an exam to calculate these kind of things. OK, I want you to understand them, but I'm not gonna ask you to go whoop and calculate the irritability of this that or the other. OK, if we rearrange these equations in like year 9 maths simultaneous equation type way, um, H2d, therefore, is twice the difference between identical and fraternal twin correlations. This formula is actually called Faulconer's formula. OK. That little one there. Balkinus formula, it's a good one to know, because the simplest one in many ways. And it's where you can use the twins without doing anything else, right? H2d, the amount of variants in the trait due to genetic variance is due is equal to 2 times the difference between the correlation in that trait between monozygotic twins and that between dizygotic twins. OK? You can then refiddle all the equations to find out each one so you can work out C and you can work out E as well. OK, we worked at E before actually with 1 minus um RMZ. Are we done there, do you think? No, Ed said yes, we're not. He's, he's too excited. We're not. Um, so think of our height example. Yeah. This is our formula to work out the heritability of height based on the correlations of our twins. So we have this formula, H2 equals 2 times the difference between 0.96 and 0.32. What is the problem that we encounter? If you haven't read it, you get more kudos. If you have, you can still say it just to move things along. Yeah. It's greater than one, which is the problem, right, because one is the entire variants of the phenotype. So, one of the reasons here, and that the height example is an example, OK, it's made up, right, that's not a genuine example, it's made up one, but it is demonstrating a point, right? This simple model that we're using here makes an assumption about genetic effects, so it assumes that all genetic effects are additive. It's also known as narrow sense heritability. So what an additive genetic effect really means is that, so say, for example, a risk is coming from little A, right? That if you have big A, big A, that's kind of the baseline, if you like. If you have big A, little A, you're gonna be 20 centimetres taller. If you have two little A's, you're gonna be 40 centimetres taller. Right? So the number of little A's dictates the extent to which you are taller. Right? So if it was 30 centimetres with one little A, you'd be 60 centimetres. With two little A's, that's the additive effect, risky, the risk conferred by an allele is increased R-fold for heterozygotes and 2 R-fold for homozygotes. So what is wrong with this assumption? Basically, we know that that's not just the way things work, OK, effects can be dominant, recessive, heterozygous, complicated, etc. etc. OK, so it makes an assumption. You right, honey? Um, so. Other things that's wrong with this assumption is that we have interactions, OK, we've already looked briefly at gene gene interactions and gene environment interactions as well. But it is a really useful model, right? So you can't just diss it and say, well, it's making these assumptions and it's, um, you know, it's too basic, it's not very good at estimating what, you know, the unique environment is, or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But it's really simple. Right? It doesn't involve doing anything to anyone. You just find big groups of twins. That's it. OK? What Um You will see in models of the additive genetic effect is referred to as A. OK, so now we have what's called the pace model. PACE phenotype, additive genetic effects, common environment and unique environment. Oh, he, quiz, quiz time. So find your bit in canvas for the quiz. Can you do that? The quiz is a question where you have, you sit back there and you can do the quiz. Yeah. OK, do we all have canvas open or not yet? You've got some minutes cos, yeah, all good, good. Are we all good? We are. OK, don't worry, if you're not all good, it doesn't matter cos remember, do not put in your answer now. Do not put in your answer now. We vote with our hands, I tell you the answer, then you uh put in the correct answer, OK? So quiz. Heritability estimates are useful because they, A, tell us how like don't, don't vote yet. A tell us how likely someone is to inherit a certain trait. B give an idea of the proportion of variants in a trait that is due to genetic factors. C show us that monozygotic twins share more of the same genes than dizygotic twins. D can be used to generalise estimates about the genetic components of traits from one population to the next. E, take into account gene environment interactions. OK, so take up your side what you think it is, and then I will, everyone shut your eyes, and we will go for it. OK, ready? Shush, you have no idea. Shush, right. That's to my son, not you. OK, you're welcome to play though, OK? So everyone shut your eyes. OK, heritability estimates are useful because they, who thinks it's A, tell us how likely someone is to inherit a certain trait. Who thinks B give an idea of the proportion of variance in a trait that is due to genetic factors. Who thinks C, show us that monozygotic twins share more of the same genes than dizygotic twins. Who thinks D can be used to generalise estimates about the genetic components of traits from one population to the next? Who thinks E take into account gene environment interactions? Hands down. Very good, everybody, we had a spread but um this is the correct answer. OK, so it doesn't tell us your likelihood of inheriting anything, that's just to do with your own personal, um. Genetics, not a population-based thing. So yes, it gives an idea of proportion of variants in the trait that is due to genetic factors, that is it, it cannot do any of the other things. OK? We can't use it to estimate different populations, and it doesn't take into account any sort of gene environment interaction. OK. So, what are some criticisms of these models? Number one, is that these values are very, very strongly tied to the populations that were used to gather the, um, data, OK? Um, So this is problematic, right, because if they're based on twins, then these estimates also depend slightly to the extent to which twin pairs actually reflect the genetic and environmental variation in the population. OK, so there are 2 problems here. One of which is that um obviously most twin pairs are raised in very similar conditions. Right? So there might be a kind of underestimation of the impact of the unique environment, because a lot of it is shared perhaps more so than if you took two random people um from different families, for example. The other issue has become, um, it's not a major one, but it's it's worth bearing in mind is that um. Do you know why twins have become more common, perhaps in the last 30 years? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So often when um someone's deciding to have IVF or try IVF they'll implant more than one embryo, right? So it might be 2, maybe 3. So they're becoming slightly more common, but, um, people who are able to use IVF may not represent the general population, right, they may be more affluent and they may be living in certain places, um, that kind of thing. OK? You, honey? Do you want a pillow? OK. Um, OK. The other thing is that they assume, they make an assumption that there's no assortative mating. So assortative mating, um, is basically non-random mating. So the model assumes that mating is at random, right? So in humans, it means that you're kind of. Having babies with someone just random, right, meet them, who have a baby, um, in reality, obviously. People choose partners based on certain traits, right? Now, they might be, um, purely like, uh, physical traits, but they may also be kind of ethnic ethnic traits, certain religious beliefs, it could be lifestyle choices, right? And those things will have certain commonalities in terms of genetics, right? So there's not actually. Um A mating. OK. So always remember this heritability estimates refer to the proportion of variation between individuals. OK. It does not dictate, indicate the degree of genetic influence on the development of a trait of an individual. So for example, because I read this every year in essays in the exam, it is incorrect to say that since the heritability of personality traits is about 0.6%, that means that 60% of your personality is inherited from your parents and 40% comes from the environment, right? You cannot move from heritability estimates to an individual, right? It gives an idea. Yeah, it gives a, it's like, it's a mean, basically, right? It gives an idea of a, of a sample, right? But it might be that one of you over there, right, 80% of your, I don't know, introversion comes from your parents, and someone over there's 20%. And overall, it'll be 0.6%. OK, so it's not, you can't make that individual leap. Um, this is recommended reading is not required. I think it also pops up in a tutorial, potentially, um. So it might be required for that, but it's not required. Not required for this one, it is recommended reading, OK? Hey, can you sit down, please? Just go on your iPad. Just so you know, you are watching ADHD in action. Um, you wanna go sit down? You wanna sit there? You can play with that if you want, take that down. OK. um. OK, so Uh, let's look at an example, right, and have a look at how this kind of, this kind of um. Information can be actually quite useful. Genetic information can be useful in terms of understanding more complex things like child psychopathology. Right? So this is a meta-analysis of 490 studies of internalising and externalising psychopathology prior to adulthood. So youth mental health, basically. So the traditional wisdom that we have from kind of twin studies and that kind of thing says that the additive genetic effect, because that's what they model, and the non-shared environment, so unique effects are of great importance for psychopathology, and that there's almost no influence of shared environments. So that's the kind of traditional stuff we had from, um, A kind of traditional wisdom from these, these sorts of twin models. However, you know, through, you look at the literature and you look at kind of individual studies, you start to notice that there may be important aspects of the shared environment that are important prior to adulthood, um, and especially when you get to more extreme environments. So, what you, I'm just giving you the outcome basically of this study. So they looked at all these different, um, areas of interest. So externalising disorders include conduct problems and oppositional defiant problems, depending on where you are in the world, some people put, um, ADHD or ADHP in with externalising disorders, um, other places don't, OK? Or some put them in with conduct problems, some people don't, so it depends where you, where you put them. Um. And then we've got internalising, which would be depression and anxiety, stress, and then some people separate into depression and anxiety as well. OK? So what we see here is, A is, so this is the metro results of the meta-analysis for each of these conditions, as you can see, huge numbers here. Right, huge. We're talking 10,957 sibling pairs across. OK? So these are, these are strong studies. A here. A squared is your additive genetic influence, right? So that's your heritability estimate, basically. Um, C is your shared environmental influences. So shared stuff, same school, same family, etc. D here is dominant genetic effects, or dominant genetic influences. So different form of genetic effects that aren't, um, picked up by those models normally. And then non shared environmental or unique environmental effects, right? And basically what you see is that um 50%, apart from ADHD 50% of pretty much everything, so approximately, and it's true it's pretty much everything um is due to genetic effects. OK? So around 50% of complex human traits are. Um, Sorry, 50% of the variants in complex human traits are genetically driven. Genetic variants. Um, interestingly, so over here we have, this is our non-hard environment, and that's what traditional wisdom said was really important. So like a unique event, a trauma, something like that. And yeah, there's a variance between about 0.25 and 0.4 something, um. Uh, of the variants, OK, so 25 to 40% of the variance. What's really interesting is that this was originally thought to be completely not important whatsoever. But actually, between 10 and 15% of variance is due to common environmental factors. OK? Common ones. We'll, we'll see what that means in a minute. Interestingly, for those who are interested, for ADHP, so that's ADHD problems, not necessarily a diagnosis, um, there's a high, high whack of dominant genetic effects, right? Which makes sense, right? We understand a bit more about what that is in terms of dopamine and stuff. Um, no shared environmental impact, right? So, family, school, etc. Yeah Um, so the conclusions, the shared environment from the study accounted for a modest to moderate amount of variance in psychopathology outcomes for every domain except ADHP, ADHD. It's also worth noting that the non-shard environment, so Esquare, the unique one, also has a very profound impact on psychopathology. Um We have increasing evidence that certain parent styles, so this is what we mean when we talk about a shared environment, OK? That certain unique parenting styles and behaviours increase kids' risk for psychopathology outcomes. So what do we mean by that? We mean this, OK, so it's the, it's the kind of basic stuff that we now know quite well. So parental overprotection, over control promotes kids' anxiety. So for example, were you nervous yesterday? Yeah. So he was very nervous yesterday, right? You want to stop it at one point? Yeah. Understandable, right? You're 80, you don't want to be unconscious. Um, and it's very easy for a parent with a child who has anxiety, even kind of beyond the kind of norm, it's very easy to kind of, um, want to overprotect, right? And overcontrol, and to go, if I'd gone, no. He's too anxious, we're not gonna do it, we're gonna delay it, we're gonna put it off. It's very easy to do that, right, cos you feel like it's the right thing to do for your kid. That's not what we did, is it? You did it and you did great, didn't you? Yeah, we, it happened, um, and he did really well, right? But it's very, very, um. It feels like the right thing to do, right? So this is, these aren't bad parents. This feels like the right thing to do. You've got a kid who's anxious, you wanna go, it's OK, you don't have to do it. What that does is make them think that the thing they're scared of is actually scary. When it's not, right? Um On the flip side, right, if you have parental hostility, so, um, aggression affecting anger, and poor boundary settings are not making things clear where they are, that will increase the likelihood that children will have externalising problems. So conduct problems, um, conduct disorder, ODD, that kind of thing. Interestingly, externalising problems in childhood are the best predictor of all common forms of mental health in adulthood, OK? With the one exception, I think anxiety in childhood still um predicts anxiety in adulthood better. And conduct problems, but conduct problems actually predict everything else better than anything else, right, so conduct problems in childhood predict depression in adulthood better. And internalising problems in childhood. So it's Useful thing to measure. OK, so. We have some pretty good ideas about how the shared and the non-shared environment may actually have an influence, right? In terms of, we know a little bit about, um, some bits of the shared environment that are important, like parenting, um, kind of, uh, effectively, poverty, things like that. That would be a shared environmental factor, right? Um, So we know something about the environmental processes that may be important. But it's also worth noting that you, when you measure something and how you measure it is really, really important. When you think about the balance between unique and shared environments, right? So how old are you? 88, right, and how much of your time do you spend at home versus with your friends? Mostly at home? Yeah, mostly right, it's 8, mostly at home. How old's your sister? 1010. Does she spend more time at home or with her friends? And it's, it's just about, isn't it? It's about 50/50 now. Right. So do you see that in 22 years? I mean, different kids, but still, um. So think about the twin stakes, right? You're looking at a common environment and the impact it has on the kids, then if they're spending all their time in that common environment, it's more likely to be having an effect right now, sorry, than if you measure when they're 15. Right, so you have to think about what you're measuring and when, or if you're asking retrospectively or or what. OK, we find it harder to think about what the genetic influence actually means, right? It has the highest impact every single time, 50% pretty much. OK? But we don't know what that means. We don't know what it is. We're like, great, yeah, highly heritable, but we don't know what we're doing with that information. So in conclusion to this, and this is from the Turkheimer paper that I recommended, not required. There's an interesting parallel between the search for the individual genes that that influence behaviour and the failed attempt to specify the non-hard environment in terms of measured environmental variables. So what you're saying is there's a, there's a similarity, right, between the fact that we can't find what genes are important for all these things, um, and a failed attempt to specify the non-shared environment. So we know the unique environment has a big effect as well. We don't know what they are. Why is it so hard, do you think, to understand, to measure the um a non-hard environment? Get a questionnaire, what question would you ask? You can't. Right, the fact that it's unique, so it's a variable that may have happened to both twins but had a different effect on both, how do you know what to ask? Yeah. It's very, very difficult. OK. Here's a point to consider for a, for a later date. I'm gonna leave you now with this little, yeah, this little guy. Um, this is Robert Sapolsky. Uh, he runs a whole lecture series, I think, on Stanford, uh, iTunes you, I think it is. I think it's certainly used to be free. I think it still is. Um, this is making the point someone was asking about when you have twins in the same, uh, monocytogotic twins, different environment, OK? And the kind of power and lack thereof, actually, of these kind of studies.

SPEAKER 1
And this one wound up being the gold standard, the high water mark of how to do behaviour genetics, behaviour geneticists who were able to do this sort of study. The rest of the behavioural geneticists hate them because they've got the best. Toys out there to play with and they've got the coolest things going and they're always snotty because they've got the best possible circumstance, the most perfect thing you can imagine, which is identical twins separated at birth. Whoa, that must be one hell of an experiment to have pulled off identical twins separated at birth. It turns out every now and then a pair of identical twins are adopted very soon after birth, where each one is adopted into a different household. Perfect. Perfect. Different environments, different households, identical genes. You could not possibly ask for something better than that. People like wet their pants when the identical twins separated at birth. Paradigm burst on the scene. This was so wonderful. People wrote. About identical twins separated at birth, sonnets. It was the best. It was so informative because look at the power of this approach. This is an incredibly powerful approach. The two individuals are raised in different environments, but they got the exact same genes. So the question becomes where are you going to find identical twins separated at birth, and this one obsessive geneticist, behavioural geneticist, University of Minnesota, Tom Bouchard, has done an entire career not only studying these folks, but God knows how he finds these people. But he first. publishing when he had 40 pairs of identical twins separated birth reunited in adulthood, and that made for some incredible bizarre heartwarming stories of discovering your long lost identical sibling and produced mountains' worth of data. It was a bizarre literature from day one. First one being that you would get the perfect case there, and what these guys would be reporting in the literature was totally nutty stuff. OK, so you've got one of these pairs of identical twins and they're born and you know. Wolfi winds up being raised in Uruguay by neo-Nazis, and Shmuel gets raised in Israel by his highly orthodox whatevers. and then, you know, as a result of a game show quirk of fate, they're suddenly brought back together and there's Wolfi and Shmuel, who are identical twins, and what do they report the most amazing thing they have in common? They both flush the toilet both before and after they go to the toilet. You think I'm being facetious. Go back to that literature when that first came out and the coverage in the press, and it would be things like Wolfi and Shmuel, they both have like a poodle named named Fluffy. They both, and the flushing the toilet before and after going to the bathroom, that was one of the landmark early findings of these studies. They would find twins that would do they would find twins who were both married to somebody named, you know, Congolia or something, and she thinks, oh my God, this is totally amazing. That was. What hit the pages initially, these obscure little bizarre similarities within a backdrop of, well, what's the data actually showing and what's by now a twin registry of probably a couple 100 sets of these twins and this has become the cottage industry of the best behaviour genetics around. What has come out of that literature is the most solid reliable findings is about 50% heritability of IQ. About 50% heritability of where you are on the introversion extroversion scale. And about 50% heritability for degree of aggression. That's kind of interesting, and what we will see is there's all sorts of problems with this approach as well. First one being starting right off back to the Cayman guy from Princeton, his critique turns out there were not a whole lot of wolffes and schmuels, even though they got adopted into different families. There again was the non-random placement in families, more similar environments than one would have anticipated purely by chance, so that as a concept. OK, so what's the solution for that one? I know. Let's look at monozygotic twins separated birth and reunited on Oprah at age 50, and then look at dizygotic twins separated birth and reunited after the commercial break on Oprah and see what the similarities are. And if you see more things in common with the monozygotics rather than the dizygotics, you've just controlled for the non-random. In the adoptive homes, the extent to which the monozygotics have traits more in common than the dizygotics that reflects the identical genes. That was the interpretation. That was a very powerful sort of analysis, one that nonetheless winds up being very limited because in this case because of tiny sample size. It's really hard to have done those studies.

SPEAKER 0
So there's a whole series there. I do recommend later on that if you have time, you go and uh watch it. If you're interested in this kind of stuff, OK, it's not part of the course of saying if you're interested. Um. But the point being really is that one, this research is really, really hard to do because of some of the variables that we've talked about before, right? So some of those limitations, which is, uh, how is it possible to get very dissimilar, um, even when you've got monozygotic or dizygotic twins who are separately adopted, like he's saying, part of the problem is that they're actually adopted into quite similar sorts of environments, right? That whether you get the extreme variation is not happening. So anyway it's just, it's an interesting thing if you want to look at that, um, a bit further, OK? So we're gonna have a break now. We're 5 minutes early, but that's fine. Um, we're gonna have a break now. When we come back, we're looking at this issue of missing heritability, interactions. I also need some volunteers. I've got one. I'll need one more. OK. Um Don't worry, it's nothing embarrassing, you're just holding something.

SPEAKER 2
So Yes. Yeah. I OK. Yeah. Yeah, so a child with a child and a parent would be safe. Yeah. Right Yeah, OK. I don't. To OK. It's a relationship. Yeah Yeah I Of the environmental factors. Yeah It's like and then they put on paper. Yeah, it's like, yeah I just, I don't know, like. It's the same thing. It is over. OK. Yeah. My first event. Yeah. I know I woke up at 5. I, I. Yeah. Yeah. I Oh. Oh I Oh. Yeah Yeah. It's like It's, it's really nice to go to. I. So I have Yeah Yeah. Oh. OK. OK. Yeah. OK. So Oh. Yeah. And Yeah. right Yeah. I. Yeah. Uh Yeah. Yeah. I just. So. I want. Yeah. Yeah Yeah. Oh. Oh Yeah. of course, but I'll be here on the. Well thank you so much. Yeah. I. I Yeah. Yeah. OK. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I. Oh. Yeah. No. Uh Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Yeah Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

All right, ready on on low boy, that's it. Go sit down. Go sit down.
