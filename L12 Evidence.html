    <h2>Evidence Table | PSYC3016</h2>

    <div class="intro">
        <strong>📋 Lecture Overview</strong>
        This lecture addresses professional adult-child interactions across contexts: <strong>research</strong>, <strong>forensic</strong> (witness/victim/suspect), and <strong>clinical</strong>. Four key principles: (1) <strong>Consent</strong> — informed, voluntary, age-appropriate. (2) <strong>Comfort</strong> — environment, familiarity, affect. (3) <strong>Reliability</strong> — maximizing quality and quantity of information. (4) <strong>Do No Harm</strong> — ethical obligations. Includes NICHD Investigative Interview Protocol for forensic child interviews.
