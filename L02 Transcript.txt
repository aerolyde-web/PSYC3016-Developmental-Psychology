OK, has everyone had a little break? Little leg stretch, etc. Excellent. Alright, almost done. I may have to pause in about 10 minutes just to get the uh. iPad that's currently, currently charging. We're good, everything's so so far so good. Alright, so now we start content proper. So lecture number 2, nature versus nurture. So look, this is the 1st of 3 lectures. Um, this one is going to look at the basics of what we mean by nature versus nurture in terms of terminology and measurement. And we're gonna, uh, bust some myths regarding nature and nurture, particularly in the area of, um, developmental cycle. Lectures 3 and 4, which will be the two lectures next week, and then go into behavioural genetics. Um, so we're gonna look at some, uh, again, more complicated ways of measuring, uh, environment and, uh, biology, and look at some interactions and effects like that. OK? So these are your learning outcomes. I'm not gonna read them out because they're right there for you. Um, but if you want to come back to this slide, just when you're looking through these, um, lectures later on when you're revising, this is probably a useful one to start with. OK? Just think about what we're wanting you to learn from this, um, content. Again, when I say understand, I mean, be able to kind of critically evaluate and argue that. OK. So what do we really mean when we talk about nature versus nurture, so. Nature kind of implies innate qualities, right? That's what people generally think about when they talk about uh nature. And as soon as you start talking about innate qualities, people start thinking about biology, specifically DNA, right, or genes. So it's kind of comes under the banner of nativism or rationalism. Um, the way I find it easy to remember things is by putting things together. So who is that? Oh yes, well done everybody. um, and this is my silly way of remembering which means which, right, because he was kind of, as far as I understand, he was innately rational. Right, his kind of species, whatever being he was, was innately rational. So innate qualities, nativism, rationalism. They don't mean exactly the same thing, but we're kind of talking about the same philosophical strand. In other words, it's this idea, right? The idea is that certain behaviours or abilities, um, are not necessarily learned from the environment but are present from birth, or that they naturally develop over time, right, but they don't need any specific environmental cues in order to come about. They're just gonna do that. So, um, It's kind of argument and it's, you know, been around for a long time, but more modern people like uh Chomsky and people argue that we have kind of certain cognitive modules that are genetically inherited, so genetically inherited psychological abilities that allow us to learn and acquire certain skills. So the example they often talk about is language, particularly grammar. So Kids will generally learn to speak, right? Um, I've got a 10 year old and an 8-year-old, um, who I constantly, who constantly constantly, well, and a 4 year old, yes, sorry, sorry, um, and so I um. I spend quite a lot of my time going like irrationally er irritated because they'd be like, I came home and I brung home my jumper, and I'm like. Brad, um, both of them. It's, it's, yeah, my issue, not this, um. But generally, like they will learn, they will acquire spoken language, plus all the grammar, plus all the weird intricacies of um the specific language. And they'll do that naturally, but they require, apart from very few children, they require intensive training to learn to read and write. OK? So the idea was there must be some kind of thing, some kind of computational factor in, um, human beings that's there from birth, right? So the poverty of the stimulus idea. Is the idea that natural language grammar is unlearnable, given the relatively limited data available to children learning a language, right? They're not taught it explicitly. They're not taught the verb comes here and the noun comes here. um, therefore they argue that this knowledge must be supplemented with some sort of innate linguistic capacity, and that's what they're sort of talking about is innate. Right, that ability to understand natural grammar. Um, so poverty of the stimulus is in a genetically inherited neurological. Module, um. Nobody can see him, obviously, because he's he's stealth, stealth mode, um. A genetic inherited neurological module that confers a somewhat universal understanding of syntax. OK. This is actually more interesting than you think in that when we, when we come to look at something like theory of mind, syntax pops up again. It's being related to that. I know, honey, are you alright there? Would you like the iPad? Yeah. Hold on one minute, everybody. Hold on OK Mm Oh yeah, sorry, yeah. Well, that's the que the question is, is, is language innate. So that's the query, right? It's saying that the ability to kind of understand, uh, grammar, they're arguing there's no training for that. Kids develop spoken language without any kind of assisting training. Yeah, if a child's in the kind of situation where there is zero input, right, 0, yes, and they will not have the ability to speak up in extreme cases, right? But there's actually required, there's not much required for a child to learn how to speak. Yeah? You're talking about kind of extreme, kind of abuse and neglect cases, or, you know, kind of what. Um, OK. OK. So, By nature we kind of mean innate, we mean uh genetic, right? Something that's there from birth. Nurture, on the other hand, we typically mean, um, an individual's kind of personal experiences, right? So it fits in with kind of behaviourism or empiricism or the idea when it comes to kind of children anyway, this idea of tabula raza or the blank slate hypothesis. So what John Locke was trying to say really was that, um, All, effectively, all human beings are born exactly the same, right? And it's then what they experience from that point onwards that creates them into what they become. So Watson said this, um, in the 1930s, this kind of purist behaviourism. Give me a dozen healthy infants, well formed, so I with no kind of biological, uh, difficulties, and my own specified world to bring them up and in, and I'll guarantee to take anyone at random and train him to become any type of specialist I might select, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and races of his ancestors. OK, so that idea is that anybody can become anything, depending on their environmental, um, situation. So at extremes, like any, like anything, when you look at the extremes, you have quite um kind of bold statements, right? One is saying I can uh take your child and make it whatever I want, regardless. The other kind of uh nature argument is saying, well, some people will say, you, you are what you're born as, and there's nothing you can do. OK, so you've got these two polarising viewpoints. So this is why the debate gets a little bit complicated, right? Because innate qualities sound like they're inflexible. When you talk about DNA, when you talk about genetics, they sound like they are things that are not flexible, i can't be changed. It's not a problem when you're saying, if someone said to you, Oh, did you know that your favourite colour is actually based in your DNA? Right, I can look at your DNA and tell you what your favourite colour is. I don't think that's true, right? But if someone said that, I don't think anyone would particularly mind. You'd be like, Oh, how interesting. Great. What is it? You know, um, if they say I can look at your DNA I can tell you what your IQ is, then people start to have a problem. Right, why do people have a problem when it changes from favourite colour to IQ? Or say risk for mental health, something like that. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely, it's far more riding on things like IQ, things like mental health propensity, yeah. Yeah, exactly, so you're kind of categorising people according to this is what your DNA says, therefore, blah blah blah blah blah. Yeah. Anything else? Yeah, exactly, determinism effectively, right? So they say, well, my, my genes say this. What is the point of me doing A, B, or C? Right? Exactly. So it becomes a tricky debate. In fact, this um Argument can be of kind of genetic determinism, which by the way, isn't what anyone is really saying like this is again extreme kind of arguments here, um, argues that science is the ultimate legitimator of bourgeois ideology. So if biological determinism is a weapon in the struggle between classes and the universities, our weapons factories and their teaching and research faculties are the engineers, designers, and production workers. OK? So that's an argument kind of against this idea of genetic determinism, by kind of looking into the biology of stuff. Getting people stuck. um. So what do we really mean? What do we actually mean? Well, one of the things that we'll look at in more detail in the next lecture is something called heritability. So heritability is how much of the variation of a trait? Typically, in these studies, we call that a phenotype. So phenotype is what the, the thing you can measure by looking at it. OK? So height is a really good example. So how much of the variation of a trait in a population is due to genetic differences in that population? OK, that is what heritability is. You will need to know that. OK, you need to understand what that means. Typically written like this, so P represents the phenotype, so the variation in that phenotype. So if I measured everyone in this room, this is our population, if I measured all your height, right, that's the variation in our phenotype. It might range from, I don't know. Want me to I'm really bad with uh metres cause I, I grew up with feet, right, so if I say crazy numbers don't blame me. 1 metre 30 to like 2 metres 10. OK, that might be the range, um. Does that mean you're really tall, I'm not sure. Um, so that variation in that is due to genetic variations, so genetic effects causing variation in the sample and also environmental effects. OK, two things. Be really careful to note that heritable does not mean the same as inherited, right? Inherited is when you pass certain genes, you pass your DNA effectively down to your children and they pass it down to their children, etc. etc. That's inherited things. He heritable is about the proportion of variation in a certain population. OK? So for example, height, and this is a remarkable picture. I don't know how they managed to have kids that of those ages where they just made this perfect like linear line of of height, um. If you looked at height in one family, for example, say one large family. The heritability of height, right, so the amount of uh variation in height due to genetic variation may increase in things like marriage. Right? Otherwise known like outbreeding, right? So if you, if they're a very tall family, and they, uh, married, had babies with someone very short, then the variation will increase. Suddenly you'll have, you'll have short children, right? The variation will increase, and that will be primarily due to genetic effects, because suddenly you, you've got the short genes in there. OK? I'm simplifying things to make the point, but you get what I mean. Yeah? Um, heritability may increase also if the environmental variation decreases. So it's a balance, a seesaw, right, a proportion. So accidentally, if you like, the proportion of variation in height due to genetics will increase if the proportion of variation due to the environment decreases. So when you have very poor diet, for example, um, you, you see stunting effectively people won't reach the height that they're capable, genetically capable of reaching. Um, so there are two ways in which heritability can change. You change the genetics or you change the environment. So how do we measure each of them, number one. So heritability estimates, these are what we use to measure the relative contributions of genetic environmental factors for any complex traits. So we looked at the example of height, but it could be um extroversion, it could be anxiety, it could be IQ, it could be anything. Um, we're gonna look at those in more detail next lecture. OK, so we're not gonna look at those right now. But if I can give you a minute to kind of talk about what we generally talk about when we're looking at genetics, particularly behavioural genetics. So we're often talking about single nucleotide polymorphisms, otherwise known as SNPs, pronounced as snips. So people talk, talk about snips, they mean these things, OK, single nucleotide polymorphisms. And what that is, is that in certain parts of DNA um. You've got all, you, you've got your little DNA molecule, you've got a little DNA helix and you've got one side here and one side here. Yep. And what you've got little pairs, they form little pairs all the way along. What the single nucleotide polymorphism or SNP means is that there's one of two things that can be at that location, right? 21 of two different, I think, amino acids that can be at that location. Um, now, it can either be big A typically stands for the most common one, right? So the most common amino acid at that, at that specific location is given the the symbol of Big A. The least common one, or the less common one, there's only two, is given little A. Which means when you have two strands of DNA, like, one on each side, um, you can have both common ones. You can have one common one and one rare one, or you can have two rare ones. OK? So it's called homozygous, dominant, or homozygous just for the, the common one, or heterozygous, if you've got one of each. So homozygous, if you've got two the same. Dominant or recessive, and then heterozygous if you've got 2. What you then do is you look to see whether, particularly the rare one is associated with disease or whatever it is you're looking at, OK? So what, what you do is you get two groups of participants, right? You get one with the disease or whatever it is you're looking at, and similar people without the disease, right? So, say you were looking at anxiety, right? You might want to look at, um, the genetics of anxiety. So you get, uh, two groups of people, you match them for age, uh, gender, SES, education, etc. But you find ones which meet criteria for, say, anxiety, and one group do not meet criteria for anxiety. OK? You then take DNA from somewhere. Typically it's from like a chee cheek swab or a saliva little sample, yeah. So not always do they use blood. And then there are different things you can do, so, um, typically what happens is that the entire DNA or genome is then basically spun out, so it's spinning out from the blood. And they place it on these little tiny chips in the lab and they actually can scan for specific snips at certain locations. So they have these pre-made snips, pre-made kind of uh plates, they're called, and they just go whoop. And they come back and tell you which snips are at which locations that you've specified. And then they, what they generally look to see is to find if certain genetic variations, for example, people that have two of the rare ones, if that's significantly more frequent in people with the disease, say with anxiety, as compared to people without anxiety, then that variation is said to be associated with the disease. Right? Does that make sense? It's just a statistical proportion thing, right, the proportion should be the same across both groups. If one group has a significantly different proportion of one sip, then they say it's associated with the disease. OK. Important to notice actually, or to be aware that the. Parts of the DNA or the snips associated with the disease might not actually directly cause the disease. In fact, generally they don't. Sometimes, um. They're in slightly random parts of the DNA. We don't really know why they're associated with the disease, they just happen to be. We'll look at that in more detail, um. In the next week's lectures, OK? It's a particularly a problem for, do you know what GWOS stands for? Yes, someone said it Do you know wide association scan? Yeah, I know, I heard you. I heard you said you know. Um, and that's when they get huge samples, like hundreds of thousands of people, and they get their DNA and then they look for, uh, associated with whatever it is they're looking for, and they just shove, get power through, through numbers. And what they often find is that something really random will pop up, and they'll be like, Oh my gosh, we've found this bit of DNA, this gene related to blah, blah, blah. Um, and yet they have no idea why. Right, cos it, it's a statistical thing, it pops up they don't know why. OK. How do we measure the environment? In many ways this is a lot easier. It's worth mentioning that there are many different types of environment. So obvious ones like your physical environment. Does your child grow up with a garden or without a garden? There's a really classic moment during COVID. So he was a newborn. Um, he was born during COVID actually. But I had two already, and there's a really classic moment where some, some lady, I think she got lambasted for it, actually, she went on TV and she was saying, you know what, COVID's great. Just spend time with your children in the garden. Right, and there's like literally half of, you know, whoever she was broadcasting, Sydney just being like, what garden? Right, we do not have a garden, so what do you want me to do with my kids? And so it's a thing, right? Do you have a garden, do you not have a garden? Um, stupid things, do you have stairs in your house or do you not have stairs in your house? Is your toddler gonna learn to climb stairs earlier or later on average than other toddlers if you do not have stairs in your house? You know, really, really basic stuff that we kind of forget about. Internal environment, diet, for anyone who's interested in um. Mental health inflammation causes of um. Poor health, diet is a massive one at the moment, particularly sugars. Um, social environment, so do you live with multiple other people? Do you live alone? Your family environment, so what kind of parenting are you exposed to, um, what kind of, you know, who else do you have in your family, and then the kind of emotional environment you have as well. So there are many different forms of environment we can measure. Um You can do it in different ways, so. A lot of developmental psychology research used to be done by direct observation. That is not true, I would say more. Does anybody think why? Why don't we do as much direct observation as we used to? Yeah. There isn't one argument, there's one argument, yeah, that if people are aware they're being recorded, they may behave differently. Absolutely, yep. What was that? So, no, generally you need a smaller sample size because you're doing more kind of in depth. Um, measurements. It's not that one. Yes. Funding. It's incredibly expensive. OK, you have to have an RA, um, students, whoever it is, um, doing that one on one, with the person at that time, OK, so it's, it's very, very expensive to fund. In many ways it is really good, right, because you can, you know, kind of see things in real time. Um, in the kind of natural scenarios, etc. um, it doesn't happen too much. Self-report questionnaires are very common, so self-report only typically for kids over the age of 8. You wouldn't really give self-report under the age of 8. But parent and teacher reports are very common as well. If you're looking at either mental health or education or behaviour, parent and teacher reports are common. There's also the kind of clinical interview. So if any of you are interested in going in that kind of direction, a kind of semi-structured clinical interview, um, can be done. And then you've got easy ones, which is public and social records and data. So countries vary in how um open their data. Ah, so I did some work which was in collaboration with Sweden when I was in the UK and, uh, Swedish laws make kind of everything open. So you can look at uh arrest histories for everybody across the entire country. Very handy when you're in criminology, very useful. OK, the good thing about these things is that they are, some of them are really quick. So self-report questionnaires, parent-teacher reports are really quick. Obviously, getting data from online, once you've got access is quick, um, relatively easy, direct observation, you can argue is quite real. Um, you can also argue that these kind of public social records is objective rather than subjective data. Unfortunately, the cons are kind of the, the opposite for the, for the, you know, same ones have pros and cons. So self-report and parent teacher reports are also subjective. Right, they're talking about themselves or their own child or the child that they know. Interestingly, they don't always correlate. Which may not seem like an issue, but if you're talking about uh trying to get an indication of one thing, like, you're trying to understand a kid's behaviour, for example, and you've got a report from the teacher, a report from the mum, report from the dad, and there is no correlation between any of the three. Right, you don't know which one's more accurate. Right, and you, you can't even kind of, some people will actually try to use a kind of middle ground and get that value, but it's important when it comes to measurement if you're not getting correlation. And of course, you have biases as well. OK? You might have biases in the way in which you're not just in the self-report or the teacher report questionnaires. You may have biases as a clinical interview, right? You may have already met the kid and decided what you think, even not consciously. So it's very tricky, um, to, to not be biassed, you know, doing a kind of clinical interview. OK. We're moving on now to um this kind of question of myths and misconceptions, and the reason I cover this is because there are so many. Um And I really want to get rid of them before we go on further. OK? So the first myth is the idea that genes dictate. OK, if you have a certain DNA, a certain snippet dictates the outcome. So for something like eye colour, um. You know, to an extent, apparently it's not actually true. There is an element of environmental influence on your eye colour as well. It's not just, um, your genes. So, you always learn it in high school, don't you? With those little, what is, is those little punnet squares? Is that what you do? Do you remember that from high school? Um, you always do this one at high school. It's like, well, if your mum's got brown eyes and your dad's got this, you're gonna have that. And they always make it far more simple than it actually is. Right? Like this guy, blonde hair, that's not me, brown eyes, me. Middle son, brown eye, brown hair, me, green eyes, neither me nor dad. Right? So it's all very complicated. favourite food, OK, sure. You can say genes dictate that they don't, but no one cares. As we've said before, it gets trickier when you're talking about more complex um. Kind of higher order uh personality traits. The implications here are actually quite serious though, so for things like social mobility. If genes dictate, and as someone mentioned earlier, if someone came to you and said, like, you know, I've looked at your genes, you have low IQ. Right, if they came and said that to you, might that make you think, well, I really wanted to be a doctor, but I'm not gonna do that anymore. OK, I'm gonna be stuck doing, um, I don't know, menial labour cos that's all I can do. Designer babies, um, if genes dictate, then the temptation perhaps to know exactly what your baby will be like. Comes to the fore, right? If that was actually true. If you could say, right, if I give them this gene, that's what they will be like. Free will, predestination comes into the kind of uh theological. Perspective as well. But here's the question, like, we know that genes don't actually dictate, right? But do they dictate what is possible? It's a different question. So if you look at something like height um and diet, right? Obviously, as you know, you'll know from your friends, you'll know from, you know, just being a human being, um, we generally, generally, kids will be around the same height as their parents. Right? In fact, when you're, when you go to the paediatrician, um, well, not you, when you take your kids to the paediatrician, they will, there's a formula they can use, right? So they typically, depending on if it's a boy or a girl, they take the height of the father, the height of the mother, and then approximately kind of halve it. And then I think they add, like, Some some percentage if it's a boy and they kind of take away some percentage if it's a girl, and that's the predicted height that the child's gonna be, right, so there is. a strong genetic component for height. Um, but there's also very strong limiting factors. So you might have the genes to be incredibly tall. Your parents might be incredibly tall, but if, particularly during childhood, right, we stop finishing on average by around 18, right, if during childhood you do not have access to nutrition. You will not grow. Full stop. So that potential might be there, but once you've passed kind of 1819, 20, it's probably gone. Yeah. In fact, you see it with kids who've had um like a serious cancer often. You'll see a blip in their height trajectory. So the body will not put effort into growing if it's trying to maintain health. Right, it doesn't, doesn't do that. Um, same way as if you're kind of malabsorbing a child will stop growing to maintain weight. Yeah. So you often see a little kind of line and then it blops for a while and then it catches up. Not 20 on the age of a child. So I want you to watch this little thing here, it's uh Morgan Freeman bizarrely, as the voiceover, but it's talking about um. This question of do genes dictate what is possible and the kind of environmental, uh, biological overlap. Give me a gun.

SPEAKER 2
A new study suggests our economic destiny may be determined by the time we are 12 because poverty can affect the brain. Martha Farah is the founder and director of the centre for Neuroscience and Society at the University of Pennsylvania. She has often wondered why do poor children perform worse on IQ tests and in school.

SPEAKER 3
Many different disciplines have tried to understand how it is that poverty shapes people's life chances. My colleagues and I are taking a neurobiological approach to this question.

SPEAKER 2
Over the past few years, Martha and her colleagues have scanned the brain architecture of hundreds of children from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds. She has found there are physical differences between the brains of the rich and the poor.

SPEAKER 3
The question we asked was what parts of the brain are dependent on that socioeconomic status for the size and shape that they eventually grow to. What we found is that several important areas do show an effect of socioeconomic status.

SPEAKER 2
Growing up in extreme poverty slows the growth of the hippocampus, which is important for learning, memory, and stress regulation. And it also shrinks the prefrontal cortex, which helps coordinate memory, perception, and motor control. Rich kids tend to have a thicker cortex than poor kids. But it is crucial to note the rich and poor aren't born with these differences. The brains of the poor start off the same as anyone else's. Their brains are, however, at greater risk of developing slowly in early childhood. It is not genetics that does the damage. It is lack of mental stimulation and the stresses of poverty.

SPEAKER 3
One difference we know exists between the childhood experiences of poor kids and wealthier kids is that the wealthier kids get more cognitive stimulation. Everything from being read to. Um, just being talked to conversation, uh, visits to interesting places, and we know that that promotes cognitive and brain development.

SPEAKER 0
So are you clear on that? The main finding is that there was no difference in the brain architecture at birth. Right? So there's not genetic differences here. What we're seeing is the uh an environmental effect. As we'll see later on, it's probably more complicated than even that, right? Um, and also we're talking on average as well. I don't want you sitting there thinking, you know, I came from a really affluent family and I was bored to death or I came from a really poor family and my parents were great. I don't want you thinking that because we're talking about averages. Yep. But it's really fascinating, right? It kind of goes to show you why you're looking at, we just have a NAPLAN results from this country. And by far the greatest number of kids who are not getting the kind of, uh, strong or exceeding, so they were developing or lower. Um, I think it was something like a third of kids in, uh, poorer or rural regions, right, compared to about 10% of kids in cities. Right? So there's a difference going on that that's, that's not genetics, right? That's something to do with the environment they are in. So the mini myth here is that biological differences must be due to genetic factors. We've just been shown that's not true. OK, they were the same at birth and they became different. Here's the point. The environment can influence your biology, as demonstrated in that video. Right? The environment you're exposed to, um, can change your neural structure, physical structure, whatever. It's also the same the other way around. Your biology can influence your environment in that if you have the genetics to be predisposed to be shy, for example, and we know that's highly heritable, doesn't mean you're gonna develop anxiety, by the way, but we know that's a highly heritable trait. You're gonna put yourself in different environments. Right, you see them at like um kids' parties. Right, there's always those kids that are like right in there, like they're right up the front, and they're like, yeah, entertainer, entertain me. And then you've got all the other kids that, well, not the other guys, you've got some in the middle and you've got some at the back who are just watching. Now there's nothing wrong with any of those kids, there's just a different kind of ways in which they interact with their environment. Yeah. In fact, my daughter, when she was little, was very, very quiet. Not at home, but just at at preschool, she was very quiet. Um, and she was incredibly shy of adults. So we thought, you know, do we need to do something? Do we, do we need to do something? Um, and so in the end, what we decided was the most practical thing to do was to enrol her in like a drama club. In Nether, Neither do kids drama. And it was so funny because when I phoned up, I thought I'd better phone up and just explain that she's not gonna be like super into it. And the lady on the phone was completely unfazed, and she went, we have two types of kids that come to our drama club. One of them are like the jazz hands, totally into it, the other is your daughter. And they're the two kids that come for exactly the same reasons, right? One are coming because they're totally into drama, the other ones are coming because their parents just want to give them a bit of confidence and like expose them to the kids that are into drama. Basically they look. Um, and of course she's now completely normal, um. But you know, there's those differences make a difference in the way you interact with the world around you. Yeah. Yeah, totally, she's, yeah, she's totally fine. um. Absolutely. I'm sure, you know, everyone will have those predispositions, right? You'll always have that predisposition to be, you know, slightly shyer, slightly more extroverted, slightly whatever. They'll always be there. It doesn't mean that's the way you need to behave, right? Because you'll behave a certain way. At some point, you'll have a positive outcome from that, and you will change the way you behave. OK, do genes dictate anything? That's the question. To some extent, yes. Right, if you're talking about a mutation. That they dictate something, but even then, it's limited, right? Think about um Down syndrome, extra chromosome 21, 1, 31, um. That's a very clear genetic mutation, right, and that's the cause for that phenotype, but within that phenotype there's massive variation. Massive variation in the um both the disability and the ability, people with Down syndrome, massive variation in the kind of medical complications that go alongside, um, so huge variation within that one phenotype that is caused by a genetic mutation. The genes dictate complex traits? No. OK. You can just say Simple, simple, simple, complex traits are not um dictated by genes, OK? Another myth and misconception, #2. The issue with the tabula raza um viewpoint, right, the idea that you can take anybody and make them whatever you want. Is that, who knows what that is, what city is that? Ya, Gotham City. I'm such a dork. Um, it is, it's very, I was getting excited when someone recognises that, um. Because it's like a failing city, right? And that's the problem with the tabula Raza, um, argument is that if your society is failing, if you've got crime, illiteracy, poverty, racism, drug abuse, etc. that means that your families, your schools, your communities, your religions, your social structures are failing, because there's no other blame. Right, if you are purely the creation of your environment, then if your environment includes those things, those bad things, your environment is failing. Um And genes are a really easy scapegoat, in fact, you see it often in politics, um. There's a kind of human bias to go, if something negative happens, if there's something bad happens, um, he goes, it's not, it's not my fault at all. You put it on something else, right? It's an environment, environmental fault. If they're positive attributes, it's all because of me. People are far more likely to say that their positive attribute is genetic. Right? Um, or biologically driven, then the negative attributes. OK, they're more likely to say that's because of A, B, and C. And that's a, that's a natural human bias that we have. We see the same thing in kind of social structure and politics. So, If it's, you know, a mayor of a town and there's a high crime rate, they might start blaming a certain, even something like a certain race, right? You could say that's a genetic argument. You can say it's not, you can say, say it's an environmental argument. But if someone starts blaming a particular, um, individual, say, a particular family, you might say they're rotten, rotten apple blah, blah, blah, in a class, we've got one bad kid. Um, That's blaming the negative attributes on something out of their control, which is um genetics, right? Versus you know, looking at the environmental explanations. A very similar thing, interesting thing happens with um. Parents who've got children, and, you know, good on them. They've got kids who are very difficult, um, have difficult behaviours, so anti-social behaviours, and they're coming to get help or assistance for that, which is very brave to begin with. But what's quite interesting is when I was working in the clinic is, you often see parents quite wanting an ADHD diagnosis. And the reason they want an ADHD diagnosis is because in their mind, they see that as more biological. Right, because we know a bit more about it, it's actually exactly the same heritable as ODD which is oppositional defiant disorder, but they see it as more kind of beyond their control. Right? In reality they're kind of the same. Um, and you understand why, right? They, they, you know, they want um help outside of their own kind of uh parenting really. OK. The plus point here is that um the argument can be made for positive things as well. So if you have a society in which there is generosity, kindness, wellbeing, etc. then that is also. Responsibility of families, schools, communities, religion, etc. so it kind of goes both ways. Um I'm, I'm hearing little giggles from from behind me, it's a bit off-putting. OK. So the point I want you to get from this is that a phenotype can be positive or negative. Typically in psychology, we only look at negative ones because we're trying to solve them. Right, so we might look at um clinical anxiety, we might look at um. Aggression. OK, and that's the phenotype we're studying, but you can, we also study positive ones as well. Right, generosity, for example. All of them are influenced by both genes and the environment, all of them. Here's a classic example, gets me annoyed. Um, the problem of violence. So you might see stuff like this. This is what I'm talking about in some kind of social media, um, media. So genes load the gun, but environment pulls the trigger. That's what that's, that thing's saying. I know what they're trying to say. I know what they're trying to say. They're saying there's a, you know, they're trying to say there's a genetic predisposition to be, A, B, or C, and in a certain environment, someone will be triggered to do that, right? But it's far too simplistic. It's far too, it's in it it's, it's kind of saying it's one way round only. It can't be the environment loads the gun and jeans pull the trigger, which of course it can. Right. And it's also it's kind of negating the idea that there are some environments in which it doesn't matter what your genes are. OK, if you're in an extreme enough environment, you're gonna do certain things. So it annoys me slightly, it's a bit too simple. Um, the other one annoys me because most of my research is in psychopathy, and the vast majority of psychopaths are not little angry looking blonde girls, right? That's just not, it's not true. But what the point they're trying to say is this argument about nature versus nurture. They're trying to say that a psychopath is born. And to be fair, they're highly heritable, right, but they're trying to say that it's some kind of like biological issue and that a sociopath is effectively a, a gang runner, right? They're in, they're in a difficult wrong criminal environment. In reality, Environment and genes are as important for both. OK. The reason that I get particularly annoyed with this example is because it's been used um forensically. So a paper came out probably about 20 years ago now, I reckon, um, about the warrior gene. Have you heard of the warrior gene? MAOA? Um, so what the MOA is a monoamine oxidase activator. Can't remember the, um, basically it's to do with how much of monoamines you've got mopping around your brain. OK, um, and what they found was that the study found that a high proportion of violent offenders. Have the low activity variant of this gene. Right, so they, they kind of map the gene, they can see which variant has high activity, which has low activity, and a higher proportion of violent offenders have the low activity variant. There's a kind of complicated interaction with child maltreatment, but for the sakes of this, you don't need to know that yet, um. But here's the rub, right, the majority of people with the low activity variant do not commit violent crime. So straight away you have an issue with logic. Right, so then you can't conclude that having the low activity variant of the MAOA gene means you're going to be committing violent crime, because the vast majority of people who have the low activity variant do not commit violent crime. Despite that, MAOA genetic testing has been used successfully to reduce a prison sentence, at least one so far, that came out, it was fairly close, I think in time to the um publication of the paper. So that means a criminal responsibility has been associated with a certain genetic profile. Which is kind of ethically, that's a massive thing. That's massive. Um, I don't know where the status of it is now, they may have changed. Um, recommendations, I'm not sure. So this is a recommended means you don't have to read it. It's just if you're interested in that situation, it's right there. Hopefully that link still works. OK, another myths and misconception is this one. I hear it a lot. All traits are heritable, so heritability is irrelevant. You hear it a lot. And it's true, all complex traits are heritable. There's a certain amount of variants um in every complex trait that is related to genetic variation. OK, that's due to genetics effectively. But the argument is being that if if all trades are heritable, then why should we care? Right, why should we care about heritability at all? I think part of this is a problem of communication, so um. There aren't that many people who work in um. Both genetics and kind of human uh behaviour, right? Um, I'm one of the people who's lucky enough to have collaborators, so I can do this work, which is great. Um, but it's not my expertise, right? I'm not about to get up and do a talk on genetics. Um. So in some respects, I think the work that's done in genetics often kind of stays in that focus in that lab, and there needs to be more communication about um how it applies to broader traits, etc. The other thing I think that happens is that people working in that clinical cycle counselling, whatever, don't, can't see how it's related to the application of psychology. Right? So they think, OK, right, traits here for is a genetic component to your aggression. How do I use that? Like, what's that, what relevance is that to me as someone treating you? OK. Um I'll come to that in a second. But here is a problem of understanding, OK? Variation in heritability. Means quite a lot. If a trait is 10% territable, it means 10% of the variance in that trait in the population is due to genetics. If it's 80% territable, That's big. Right? That's pretty big. So the gene actually really matters. You know, if our goal here is to try and work out how to help someone be less aggressive or help someone be less anxious, or help whatever it is, what trait we're looking at, help someone be more generous, right? Um. And we know it's 80% heritable. Then it makes sense that we try and understand. How that's working, neurologically. Right? So if it, if the gene is in a certain neurotransmitter system, that's useful, right? So we know in terms of something like ADHD we know that dopamine system is involved because that's what the genetic test studies have shown us. We don't know exactly how, but we know it's involved. So for example, um, and I'll come back to this in a later lecture actually, we look at something like, um, treatment resistance. So kids with conduct disorder, which is severe anti-social behaviour, um, tend to be characterised by the presence or absence of callous unemotional traits. Callous unemotional traits are like lack of empathy, lack of shame, psychopathic type stuff. The vast majority of kids have low levels of CU traits, so they're not psychopathic. Right? The vast majority of kids who are, are naughty, put it this way, um, have low levels of CU traits. The minority that have high. What we find when we look at the heritability estimates for conduct problems. Is that in kids with low levels of CU traits, they're described as hot cos they're often impulsive, often comorbidities with ADHD, anxiety and stuff, um. We find that the heritability estimate for conduct problems is 30%. OK, fair enough. When you look at the minority who have high levels of CU traits, suddenly the heritability estimate for conduct problems jumps up to 81. So why is that important? Why is that, why do you think that might be important as someone working with these kids or trying to, you know, treat these kids? Who wants to guess, go on. Yeah Yeah, and that's what we see in the research, right? So we've seen in the research that treatment effects for those with low levels of CU traits are much higher. Right, they do respond to treatment. They do respond to parenting interventions of the change in the environment, they do. The other thing it shows us is the mechanism can't be the same. Right, you can't treat all people the same. Because they're not. So why do treatments not work very well for these kids? Well, it looks like there's a different mechanism going on. It's 80% heritability. So what genes are they and what are they doing? Ooh, hang on. This is exciting, right, this is your first in sorry, change, this is your first uh quiz in lecture quiz, right? So for those of you who don't know what to do, you need to go to Canvas and it should say week one. And you should be able to select A, B, C, or D or E. Don't press anything yet. Nobody pressed it. OK. Has anybody not found the quiz page on Canvas? Cos you have to enter something here or you don't get the points. OK, so who can, who can direct people? I think if you go on to the main page of kind of front 3016 page and you look at that little timetable thing, it should say week one along the top, does it? Yes, click on that. Did that work? Click on that. OK, good. It's really confusing because I don't get student view. I have to kind of select student view, so I know canvas from like my view, so I have to assume that it's the right one. So is everyone there? Yes. Anyone not there because I don't want you to miss out on the points. You're not there? Can you help over there? No worries. OK, anyone else not found it yet? You, OK, yep. That's right. I was Anybody else. Are you OK? Yeah, um, OK. If you haven't found it, don't worry. Oh yeah. Have you found one? No? But when people move arms like like some kind of vigilant thing. um, OK, here is the quiz question. Do not put in the answer yet. I'm gonna do a blind vote. Which means you all shut your eyes and then put your hand up when I say the letter you think it is, OK? Here's the question, which of the following is not a source of environmental variation? OK, which is not a source of environmental variation. So everybody shut your eyes. Well done everybody, OK, who thinks the answer, which of these is not a source of environmental variation? A, the income of a child's family. B. The hormonal conditions in utero. See, the relationship between a mother and child. D, the age of the child. E, the child's diet. And open your eyes. OK, um, the answer is D. Here we go. um, the correct answer is the age of the child. That's just a chronological, biological thing. Interestingly, the one that catches everybody out is the hormonal conditions in utero, cos it's biological, right, it's a biological condition, um but it still counts as an environment for that growing. Embryo foetus, right? OK. So now enter D. Press D in canvas. It won't do anything, I think it just goes, you've submitted your your answer, great. Have you submitted it? Yeah. OK, if you haven't done it, just, just press D, D. Alright. So #4, myth number 4. Um What about the mechanism? This is a really big one, I think, OK, Genetics tells, this is a myth, genetics tells us nothing about the aetiology of where it comes from. In some ways, this is a fair point. Right, when you look at GWORL scanning, which is kind of where you get enormous samples and you spin it and you try and find an association with a certain disorder or disease, um, or phenotype. People describe this as a fishing trip. There's no kind of a priori uh hypothesis here. And it can identify regions of DNA coding for seemingly unrelated proteins, right? And it might also identify areas of DNA that might not even have functional relevance. We might not even know what their functional point is, right? Just kind of areas of random code. So how do we get from genotype, i.e. what genes are important to the phenotype? My point here would be that it's really hard. It is actually really hard, but just because it's hard doesn't mean it's not worthwhile. So it's all about mechanism, right? So we need to be hypothesis driven. In terms of molecular genetics. So you need to think about gene function, what a gene actually does. We need to have targeted systems. So evidence comes from other research that points to, say, a certain, uh, neurochemical system, right? So for example, in anxiety and depression, evidence might point towards serotonin, right, generally because we use drugs that work for some people, although we don't know why they work. Um, but that's where that comes from, right? So there's something about the serotonin system that's important. So it makes sense to start there. If you look at previous research, this is why shared data and free access, uh, is really important. So you can look at other people's data and that replication, so we know we're doing something that is solid, right, we're not just finding a random result that wouldn't replicate. Um, I won't read this out to you, I'll just read you a little snippet. So this is from a guy called Rob ploughman, um, who worked in the UK in, is he still there? There's a big, big, big kind of uh molecular genetic psychology um study in London, sorry, research centre in London. He's the head of it. Um. And he says that the future of developmental psychology basically lies in molecular genetic studies. He says in 1993, a gene was identified that increases 5, sorry, increases risk fivefold for dementia later in life. Study of this gene can now be used to investigate its effects earlier in life, in development, its effects on other types of dementia and other comorbid disorders such as depression, and its correlation and interaction with environmental factors. In other words, he's saying if you find one gene that does something and suddenly it opens the door to understand a lot of other things. OK, obviously there's no one gene that's like, I'm a dementia gene, right? It has another function as well. It's doing, it's doing the functional thing. Number 5, genetic literacy. Um, and this is the big problem I think is that the general public will misinterpret genetic findings. It's a big problem. So how many of you have heard of fat genes, for example? There've been shows on TV about, um, you know, a certain number of genes that kind of dictate, if they like, I like to say, um, someone's propensity to be overweight or obese. Now that may be true, that there may be variation associated with certain genotypes. Absolutely. The problem is, is it has a real impact on a locus of control. Locus of control is effectively what we talked about kind of before when we were saying, like, if you say something is dictated genetically, then suddenly what's the point of you doing anything? OK, so if you tell somebody, you have a gene risk factor for being overweight or obese, it might mistakenly make them think that there's nothing I can do. OK. An example I can give you here is I was working with, um, a school for kids with behaviour issues, and there's a boy with very, very severe, um, ADHD and, uh, conduct disorder as well. Anyway, he's a really nice boy underneath it all, um, and quite a, quite a clever boy, and I was talking to him one day. And he said to me, and now I don't know if, I don't know whether this actually came from his psychiatrist or not, or whether he misinterpreted. Either way, this was the information that he had in his head, his head about ADHD. Under his understanding, he had been told that his brain was different from everybody else's. And therefore there was nothing he could do. Right, so there's this little kind of, I think it was 14 year old. Going around, to be fair, being a terror, right, um, but he had this underlying thinking that, you know, his brain was not working properly and it could never could. That's just how it was, right, so of course, if he's got the mindset of I can't be any different, why would he bother? You know, why would he try? So what's the solution, one of which is education, including psychologists, to understand the relevance of genetic findings, OK, understanding systems, understanding processes. Communication of that information to the broader society through media, um. And here's a point to consider, um, that I won't go into now, as I've said. So question number one, what can psychology do to alter genes? Point to consider #2 is early intervention only concerned with reducing future environmental risk factors. OK? You don't need to do them now, they're something you can come back to at a later time. OK, so what do we not mean? We do not mean either or. OK, the versus debate is actually over. When I hear Nature versus Ning come up on the media, social media, I lose my mind. It's like that's freaking 50 years out of date. Right, nature versus nurture is over. There isn't so such thing. We do not mean that genetic environmental factors are equally important for all traits, and high heritability does not mean that psychological study is worthless. We'll look more into this next week. So as I said, that was the first of 3 lectures. The next 2, and when I say keep all this in mind as you progress through the course, I do actually mean that. The next two will look into this kind of behavioural genetics issue more closely. OK. Oh, finally, here you go. So, as I said, we tend to talk only about negative phenotypes in psychology. So I thought as a little thing, you'd have a little video of positive phenotypes. Just to feel cosy and warm. All right everyone, see you next week. Do not forget you need to do your, your tutorial quiz question this weekend. Yes, the readings are available already on Canvas. Around 200 words is don't go overboard, um. Due in before Monday at 8 a.m. Hello, thank you.

That's gonna be on the lecture me to say sorry to all those listening online, I would just like to point out that my 4 year old was finding the uh microphone quite fun. So if you discovered this on the end of the lecture recording. We do apologise, don't we?

SPEAKER 1
Yes, I do. That.
