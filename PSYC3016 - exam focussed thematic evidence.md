## Q1: NATIVIST VS CONSTRUCTIVIST (Infant Cognition)

- **Philosophical Poles**: NATIVISM (Spelke, Baillargeon) = infants born with core knowledge modules (object unity, solidity, permanence); looking time reveals innate understanding. CONSTRUCTIVISM (Piaget, Thelen) = knowledge built through action and experience; infants construct understanding gradually. RECONCILIATION: Competence-performance gap — both measure real knowledge, different access routes.

| Concept (Author, Year) | Age/Timing | Description/Quote | Theoretical Position |
|------------------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Moving Rod / Object Unity (Kellman & Spelke, 1983) | 4 months | Infants perceive rod behind occluder as single object when it moves together. Common motion triggers unity perception. Stationary rod = no unity. | Nativism: Innate object module activated by specific trigger (motion). Core knowledge present before experience. |
| Drawbridge Paradigm (Baillargeon, 1987) | 4.5 months | Infants look longer at impossible event (drawbridge passes through hidden block). Suggests understanding of object solidity and permanence. | Nativism: Core knowledge of physical laws present in early infancy. Violation-of-expectation = innate concepts. |
| Categorical Perception VOT (Eimas, 1971) | 2 days | Newborns discriminate phonemes across category boundaries excellently but poorly within categories. Never learned these distinctions. | Nativism: Born with phoneme categories; perceptual system pre-tuned for language. Poverty of stimulus for phonemes. |
| Poverty of Stimulus (Chomsky, 1965) | 2-5 years | Children never hear island violations ("*What did you see the man who bought?") yet never produce them. No negative evidence in input. | Nativism: Universal Grammar must be innate. Statistical learning insufficient for complex syntax. |
| Sensorimotor Stages (Piaget, 1954) | 0-24 months | 6 stages from reflexes to mental representation. Knowledge = internalized action. A-not-B error shows action-bound permanence. | Constructivism: No innate knowledge; infants construct understanding through sensorimotor exploration. |
| Familiarization Critique (Cohen & Cashon, 2006) | 4.5 months | Baillargeon used familiarization not habituation. Preference may be familiarity not impossibility. Methodological confound. | Constructivism: Looking time evidence ambiguous. Different methods = different conclusions. |
| Feature vs Spatial Memory (Meltzoff & Moore, 1998) | 5-9 months | 5mo remember object features but not continuous paths. 9mo expect objects to move continuously. Gradual emergence. | Constructivism: Not modular emergence but graded development. Knowledge accumulates, not unlocks. |
| Embodied Cognition (Thelen, 2001) | varies | A-not-B error eliminated by postural reset. Memory is body-state-dependent. Ankle weights accelerate stepping. | Constructivism: Motor experience causally drives cognitive development. Body leads mind. |
| Visual Cliff (Gibson & Walk, 1960; Campos) | 6-9 months | Fear of depth requires crawling experience. Pre-crawlers show no avoidance. Experience creates perceptual knowledge. | Constructivism: Experience-expectant development. Perception built through action. |
| Competence-Performance Gap (various) | 4-9 months | Looking time (habituation) shows knowledge at 4mo. Reaching shows same knowledge at 9mo. Same competence, different performance. | Reconciliation: Both camps right — different measures tap same underlying knowledge differently. |
| 4-Pair Relational Learning (Ferry et al., 2015) | 7-9 months | Single pair = object-specific encoding. Four pairs = relational abstraction (same/different). Exemplar count matters. | Reconciliation: Capacity limits, not absence. Infants CAN abstract relations given sufficient support. |
| Pattern Extraction Age Effect (Cohen & Strauss, 1979) | <30 vs >30 weeks | Younger infants show novelty to all stimuli. Older infants show condition-specific responses. Maturation unlocks pattern extraction. | Reconciliation: Development unlocks access to existing computational capacities. |

## Q2: TWIN STUDIES IN DEVELOPMENT

- **Philosophical Poles**: BEHAVIOUR GENETICS = partition phenotypic variance into genetic (A), shared environment (C), and unique environment (E). MZ twins share 100% genes; DZ share 50%. Excess MZ similarity = genetic influence. LIMITATIONS: EEA violation, tiny adoption samples, assortative mating. PUZZLE: Twin h² ≈ 50% but GWAS explains <10% ("missing heritability").

| Concept (Author, Year) | Age/Timing | Description/Quote | Theoretical Position |
|------------------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Twin Method Logic (Galton, 1875; modern BG) | any age | MZ (monozygotic) share 100% genes; DZ (dizygotic) share 50%. If MZ more similar than DZ, excess similarity = genetic influence. | Behaviour Genetics: Natural experiment separates G from E. Twins = controlled comparison. |
| ACE Model / Falconer's Formula | any age | h² = 2(rMZ − rDZ); c² = rMZ − h²; e² = 1 − rMZ. A + C + E = 1.0 (variance must sum to total). | Quantitative genetics: Precise partitioning of variance sources. Mathematical foundation of BG. |
| Model Selection from DZ Pattern | any age | If rDZ < ½rMZ → use ADE (dominance). If rDZ ≈ ½rMZ → use AE. If rDZ > ½rMZ → use ACE. DZ correlation diagnoses model. | Method: DZ pattern tells you which model fits. Not all traits follow ACE. |
| Meta-Analysis Findings (Burt, 2009) | childhood | Most psychological disorders: h² ≈ 50%, c² = 10-16%, e² = 25-40%. Genes matter but not everything. | Finding: Consistent moderate heritability. Both genes and environment contribute. |
| ADHD Exception | childhood | c² = 0% for ADHD. Uses ADE model (dominance effects). Total h² = 70%. No shared environment effect. | Finding: Not all disorders show parenting effects. ADHD = high heritability, dominance model. |
| Parenting Effects Measurable | childhood | Overprotection → anxiety (c² = 12%). Hostility → externalizing (c² = 14-16%). Some shared environment effects real. | Finding: Parenting matters for some outcomes. Not genetic determinism. |
| Equal Environments Assumption (EEA) | any age | Assumes MZ treated no more similarly than DZ. But MZ treated more alike → inflates h², underestimates c². | Limitation: Core assumption may be violated. h² estimates may be biased upward. |
| MZ Reared Apart Studies | varies | "Gold standard" but N ≈ 100 across all studies. Non-random placement (similar SES). Volunteer bias. | Limitation: Small, biased samples. Not truly random separation. |
| Assortative Mating | adult | Partners selected non-randomly (similar education, personality). DZ actually share >50% genes. Deflates h² estimates. | Limitation: Violates 50% sharing assumption. h² may be underestimated. |
| Missing Heritability (Turkheimer, 2000) | any age | Twin h² ≈ 50% yet GWAS explains <10%. "We know THAT genes matter, not WHAT genes." | Puzzle: Epistasis, rare variants, impure phenotypes. Complexity defeats simple models. |

---

## Q3: BEHAVIOUR GENETICS AND TREATMENT

- **Philosophical Poles**: GENETIC DETERMINISM (rejected) = genes as fate, nothing can change. DIFFERENTIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY (Belsky, Boyce) = "orchid" children worst in adversity but BEST in enrichment; "dandelion" children stable either way. TREATMENT IMPLICATION: h² predicts who responds; target environment (E) since can't change genes (G); earlier intervention = better outcomes.

| Concept (Author, Year) | Age/Timing | Description/Quote | Theoretical Position |
|------------------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Conduct Disorder CU Heritability | childhood | Low CU: h² = 30%, treatment response 60%. High CU: h² = 81%, treatment response 20%. Heritability predicts response. | Treatment matching: h² identifies who benefits from intervention. Higher h² = harder to treat. |
| Differential Susceptibility (Belsky & Pluess, 2009) | childhood | Orchids = worst in adversity, BEST in enrichment. Dandelions = flat response. "Plasticity genes" not "risk genes." | Reframe: Genetic sensitivity goes BOTH ways. Right environment transforms vulnerability to advantage. |
| Fast Track RCT + NR3C1 Gene | childhood | Orchids (A-allele): 75%→18% conduct problems with intervention. Dandelions (GG): 50%→50% regardless. | Differential susceptibility: Crossover interaction proves susceptibility. Orchids respond dramatically. |
| Crossover Interaction Pattern | any age | Lines cross: orchids worse AND better than dandelions depending on environment. Signature of susceptibility. | Methodology: Crossover proves differential susceptibility vs diathesis-stress (one-way vulnerability). |
| MAOA "Warrior Gene" G×E (Caspi, 2002) | childhood | MAOA + maltreatment → violence. 30% carry gene, 95% non-violent, PPV = 5%. Gene alone doesn't determine. | G×E: Environment moderates genetic expression. Target the E since can't change G. |
| h² Seesaw Effect | any age | Reduce environmental variance (uniform environment) → h² increases. h² is context-dependent, not fixed property. | Caution: h² is population statistic, not individual destiny. Changes with environment. |
| Down Syndrome Phenotypic Variation | from birth | Same genetic mutation (trisomy 21) → massive phenotypic variation in outcome. Clear genes ≠ determinism. | Caution: Even "genetic" conditions show environmental influence. Genes don't dictate outcomes. |
| Quebec Ice Storm Epigenetics (1998) | prenatal | Prenatal stress → altered DNA methylation → effects persist 10+ years. Experience literally writes on genome. | Epigenetics: Environment becomes biology. Prenatal = critical period for epigenetic programming. |
| Methylation Reversibility | any age | Epigenetic changes = expression change WITHOUT sequence change. Methylation blocks transcription. Reversible. | Hope: "Written in pencil, not ink." Intervention can potentially reverse epigenetic marks. |
| Primary vs Secondary Psychopathy (Lykken, 1957; Cleckley, 1941) | childhood | Primary: genetic, low anxiety, h² = 0.81, male 5-10:1. Secondary: trauma, high anxiety, 2:1. Different pathways. | Treatment: Same behavior, different etiology. Must distinguish subtypes for appropriate intervention. |
| CU Treatment Efficacy by Age | <7 vs >7 years | Hot children: 70-80%. Primary CU <7yo: 50-70%. Primary CU >7yo: 30-40%. Earlier = better. | Critical period: Intervention timing matters. Window closes with development. |

---

## Q4: PIAGET'S COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT

- **Philosophical Poles**: PIAGET = constructivism, knowledge IS internalized action, no innate concepts, domain-general stages, active child constructs understanding. CRITICS = underestimated infants (looking time studies), some things ARE innate (phonemes), stages too rigid, domain-specific not general. RECONCILIATION: Piaget right about process (construction), wrong about timing; competence-performance gap explains discrepancy.

| Concept (Author, Year) | Age/Timing | Description/Quote | Theoretical Position |
|------------------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Jacqueline Spoon Observation (Piaget, 1952) | 9 months | Spoon from glass → opens mouth; from saucepan → closes mouth. Means-ends coordination. Stage 4 sensorimotor. | Piaget Right: Knowledge = action schemes. Infant "knows" through behavioral anticipation. |
| Lucienne Matchbox (Piaget, 1952) | 18 months | Opens/closes mouth while looking at matchbox, then solves. Stage 6 mental representation. Symbolic simulation. | Piaget Right: Internal representation emerges from sensorimotor experience. Thinking before doing. |
| A-not-B Error (Piaget, 1954) | 8-12 months | Infant searches previous location A despite seeing object moved to B. Action-bound object permanence. | Piaget Right: Knowledge tied to action schemes. Demonstrates stage-like progression. |
| Assimilation vs Accommodation (Piaget) | any age | Existing scheme fails to assimilate → must accommodate (modify scheme). Disequilibrium drives transitions. | Piaget Right: Active construction through scheme modification. Not passive absorption. |
| Drawbridge Study (Baillargeon, 1987) | 4.5 months | Infants look longer at impossible event. Knowledge present before action. Eyes know at 4mo. | Piaget Wrong: Underestimated infant competence. Looking reveals knowledge before reaching. |
| Phoneme Discrimination (Eimas, 1971) | 2 days | Categorical perception innate. Never learned phoneme boundaries. Born with categories. | Piaget Wrong: Some things ARE innate. Not all knowledge constructed from experience. |
| Analogy with Familiar Content (Goswami & Brown, 1990) | 3 years | 3-year-olds solve analogies when content is familiar. Don't need formal operations stage. | Piaget Wrong: Stages too rigid. Content/familiarity matters more than stage. |
| Domain-Specific Learning (various) | any age | Piecemeal transfer failures. Expertise = chunking within domains. No single cognitive engine. | Piaget Wrong: Domain-general claim fails. Mind is modular, not unitary processor. |
| Competence-Performance Gap (various) | 4-9 months | Looking (habituation) at 4mo. Reaching at 9mo. Same underlying knowledge, different access. | Reconciliation: Piaget measured performance (action), not competence (knowledge). Both real. |
| A-not-B Embodied Reinterpretation (Thelen, 2001) | 8-12 months | Postural reset eliminates A-not-B error. Memory is body-state-dependent. Action ≠ concept. | Reconciliation: Embodied cognition updates Piaget. Body-mind integration, not mind-only. |
| Relational Complexity (Halford, 1993) | 2-11 years | 2-3yo: unary relations. 5yo: binary. 11yo: ternary. Processing capacity, not stages. | Reconciliation: Capacity limits explain age differences. Continuous not stage-like development. |

## Q5: HUMAN UNIQUENESS (vs Other Primates)

- **Philosophical Poles**: CONTINUITY (Darwin) = humans differ in degree, not kind; shared evolutionary heritage with great apes. DISCONTINUITY = humans uniquely possess explicit ToM, shared intentionality, language as cognitive tool, regularization. EVIDENCE: Chimps share implicit ToM, imitation, helping, self-recognition — but lack explicit false belief, recursive shared knowledge, symbolic language.

| Concept (Author, Year) | Age/Timing | Description/Quote | Theoretical Position |
|------------------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Food Competition Study (Brauer et al., 2007) | adult chimps | Subordinate chimps retrieve hidden food 42% vs visible 27%. Understand what dominant can see. | Shared: Chimps track others' visual perspective. Basic ToM component present. |
| Rational Imitation Foot-Pressing (Gergely et al., 2002) | adult chimps | Chimps copy hand-pressing when hands occupied, foot when free. Infer rational constraint. | Shared: Rational imitation without mental state reasoning. Teleological cognition shared. |
| Altruistic Helping (Warneken & Tomasello, 2006) | 18mo human; adult chimp | Adult chimps help reaching 40-60%; 74% genuinely altruistic (no reward expectation). | Shared: Helping behavior not uniquely human. Prosociality has evolutionary roots. |
| Mirror Self-Recognition Rouge Test (Gallup, 1970) | 18mo human; adolescent chimp | 75% of chimps pass by adolescence. 50% of 2yo humans pass. Mark-directed behavior. | Shared: Self-awareness present in great apes. Not uniquely human capacity. |
| In-group Yawning (Campbell & de Waal, 2011) | adult chimps | In-group 3.1 yawns vs out-group 0.3. 15-fold selectivity. Social modulation of contagion. | Shared: Us-vs-them distinction in chimps. Social cognition has evolutionary depth. |
| Implicit False Belief Eye-Tracking (Krupenye et al., 2017) | adult apes | Great apes: 70% anticipatory gaze to false belief location. Implicit ToM present. | Shared: Implicit false belief in apes. Automatic ToM system evolved before humans. |
| Explicit False Belief Absent in Apes (Call & Tomasello, 2008) | adult apes | Apes fail explicit (verbal/behavioral) false belief tasks despite passing implicit (eye-tracking). | Unique: Two-pathway dissociation. Explicit ToM = human innovation. |
| Two-Pathway Hypothesis (Apperly & Butterfill, 2009) | any age | Apes (implicit+/explicit-) mirror HFASD (implicit-/explicit+). Independent systems. | Unique: Explicit ToM requires language/culture. Different evolutionary trajectory. |
| Shared Intentionality Hide-and-Seek (Tomasello, 2005) | 14 months | 14mo humans infer shared game context. Chimps see only directional cue. Recursive knowledge. | Unique: "We know that you know that I know." Shared intentionality = human specialization. |
| Number Words and Exact Arithmetic (Gordon, 2004) | adult Piraha | No number words >3 → no exact arithmetic despite intact approximate and small-number systems. | Unique: Language scaffolds cognition. Symbolic tools enable new cognitive capacities. |
| Same/Different Relational Learning | 3 months human; adult chimp | Humans show same/different at 3mo. Chimps need extensive training, reach ~60% vs human 85%+. | Unique: Born relational thinkers. More efficient/spontaneous abstraction. |
| Nicaraguan Sign Language Regularization (Senghas et al., 2004) | children 2-10yo | Children exceed adult input: 75% componential vs parents' 70%. Regularize inconsistent input. | Unique: Children don't passively absorb — they improve language. Active construction. |

---

## Q6: LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT (Linguistic Relativity)

- **Philosophical Poles**: LINGUISTIC DETERMINISM (strong Whorf) = language determines thought; without words, concepts impossible. UNIVERSALISM = thought independent of language; all humans share same cognitive architecture. MODERN VIEW: Language shapes/scaffolds thought without determining it; bidirectional influence; some universals (core number, categories) but language extends capacities.

| Concept (Author, Year) | Age/Timing | Description/Quote | Theoretical Position |
|------------------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Piraha Number Words (Gordon, 2004) | adult | No words for exact numbers >3. Systems 1 (1-3 precise) and 2 (approximate) intact. Exact arithmetic absent. | Language shapes: Number words enable exact quantification. Without words, capacity absent. |
| Homesigner Spatial Relations (Gentner et al., 2013) | 4-6 years | Hearing children 4;10: 73% neutral spatial responses. Homesigners 5;6: only 45%. Language bootstraps space. | Language shapes: Spatial language enables relational encoding. Without signs, impaired. |
| Shape Bias and Vocabulary (Landau et al., 1988; Smith) | 2+ years | "Dax" generalized by shape not color/texture. Shape bias correlates with vocabulary size. Labels slice world. | Language shapes: Words create categories. Naming directs attention to features. |
| Labels Promote Abstraction (Gentner, 2013) | 3-5 years | High alignability + label = 85% relational transfer. Label alone adds 3% over alignability. Words focus attention. | Language shapes: Labels highlight relational structure. Comparison + language = abstraction. |
| Same/Different Before Language (Ferry et al., 2015) | 3-7 months | Before language, infants detect same/different relations. Relational cognition pre-linguistic. | Universal: Thought before talk. Some abstraction capacity language-independent. |
| Core Number Systems (Feigenson, Dehaene) | from birth | System 1: precise 1-3. System 2: approximate large numbers. Present in all cultures, infants, animals. | Universal: Number sense innate. Not created by language, only extended by it. |
| Phoneme Categories Innate (Eimas, 1971) | 2 days | Categorical perception before any language exposure. Born with phonetic categories. | Universal: Some perceptual categories pre-linguistic. Not all categories from language. |
| Perceptual Narrowing (Werker & Tees, 1984) | 6-10 months | Japanese lose /r/-/l/; English lose Hindi contrasts. Experience shapes categories. Reversible with input. | Interaction: Language tunes perception. Bidirectional influence, not determinism. |
| Subset-Knower Stages (Wynn, Le Corre) | 2-4 years | Pre→One→Two→Three→Four→Cardinal Principle. Inductive leap 3.5-4.5yo requires counting words. | Interaction: Counting words scaffold number concepts. Language enables but doesn't determine. |
| Regularization by Children (Hudson Kam & Newport, 2005) | 5-7 years | 60% consistent input: adults reproduce 60%, children regularize to near-categorical. Active construction. | Interaction: Children don't passively absorb language. Transform and improve input. |

---

## Q7: ATYPICAL INFORMS TYPICAL DEVELOPMENT

- **Philosophical Poles**: DEFICIT MODEL = atypical as "broken" version of typical; identify what's missing. DISSOCIATION MODEL = atypical reveals independent systems; what breaks vs what's preserved shows modularity. DEVELOPMENTAL VIEW = delay vs deficit distinction; atypical may show same trajectory, just slower.

| Concept (Author, Year) | Age/Timing | Description/Quote | Theoretical Position |
|------------------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Sally-Anne ASD Study (Baron-Cohen et al., 1985) | 4+ years | Autism: 20% pass vs Down syndrome/Typical: 85%. ToM specifically impaired, other cognition intact. | Dissociation: Reveals ToM as separate module. Selective impairment = independent system. |
| Implicit vs Explicit ToM in HFASD (Senju et al., 2009) | adolescent | Perfect explicit (verbal reasoning) but 50% implicit (eye-tracking). Different routes to same knowledge. | Dissociation: Two ToM systems. HFASD = explicit works, implicit impaired. |
| HFASD Catches Up (Scheeren et al., 2013) | adolescence | n=194: NO differences in 2nd-order false belief by adolescence. Delay not deficit. | Developmental: Same endpoint, different timing. Atypical ≠ permanently impaired. |
| Eye Contact CU (Dadds et al., 2006) | childhood | CU children don't look at eyes. When instructed "look at eyes," deficit disappears. Attention not recognition. | Mechanism: Reveals attention allocation vs perceptual processing distinction. Targetable. |
| BLA vs CeA in CU (Blair, 2008) | childhood | Basolateral amygdala UNDERACTIVE (automatic attention); Central amygdala INTACT (explicit fear). | Mechanism: Amygdala subregion specificity. Automatic vs controlled fear processing separable. |
| VIM and Moral-Conventional (Blair, 1995) | childhood | Impaired Violence Inhibition Mechanism → smaller M/C gap (1.23 vs 1.84 typical). Distress detection broken. | Mechanism: Reveals moral circuit component. VIM = automatic distress response enabling morality. |
| Fear Conditioning in Psychopathy (Lykken, 1957) | adult | Reduced conditioned fear. Newman (2010): normalizes when directed to attend. Automatic threat detection deficit. | Mechanism: Fear-potentiated startle normal; conditioning impaired. Automatic, not explicit fear. |
| h² Predicts Treatment Response | childhood | High CU h² = 81%, treatment response 20%. Low CU h² = 30%, treatment response 60%. | Treatment: Heritability identifies who benefits. Personalized intervention. |
| Primary vs Secondary Psychopathy | childhood-adult | Primary: genetic, low anxiety, h² = 0.81. Secondary: trauma, high anxiety. Same behavior, different cause. | Treatment: Must distinguish subtypes. Different etiology = different intervention. |
| Apes Mirror HFASD Pattern (Krupenye, 2017) | any age | Apes (implicit+/explicit-) = opposite of HFASD (implicit-/explicit+). Phylogeny meets pathology. | Bridge: Evolutionary and clinical evidence converge. Two independent ToM systems confirmed. |

---

## Q8: CULTURAL UNIVERSALS VS VARIATION

- **Philosophical Poles**: UNIVERSALISM = same cognitive architecture everywhere; development follows universal patterns; cross-cultural differences are surface-level. CULTURAL RELATIVISM = cognition shaped by cultural tools, practices, values; no culture-free development. MODERN VIEW: Universal capacities, culturally variable expression; same mechanisms, different inputs/emphases.

| Concept (Author, Year) | Age/Timing | Description/Quote | Theoretical Position |
|------------------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Object vs Context Focus (Kuwabara & Smith, 2012) | 3-5 years | US: shape bias 75%→58% with rich objects (vulnerable). Japan: 75%→75% invariant. Object-focus cultural. | Variable: Attention patterns culturally shaped. American object-focus, Japanese holistic. |
| Visual Search Trade-offs (Masuda & Nisbett, 2001) | adult | Americans faster at meaningful scenes. Japanese equal meaningful/random. Different search strategies. | Variable: What you attend to culturally learned. Not better/worse, different. |
| Context-Dependent Memory (Hong Kong study) | adult | Hong Kong Chinese impaired when backgrounds swap. Americans equivalent any background. | Variable: Encoding strategies differ. Context-binding culturally variable. |
| Memory Methods (Reser, 2021) | adult | Untrained 24%. Memory palace 46%. Aboriginal narrative-place method 64% perfect recall. | Variable: Cultural tools for cognition. Indigenous methods outperform Western. |
| Simultaneous Attention (Correa-Chávez, 2005) | childhood | Traditional Mayan 48% simultaneous attention vs European American 27%. Observation learning. | Variable: Attention capacity culturally developed. Community practices shape cognition. |
| Inductive Reasoning Asymmetry (Medin) | childhood-adult | Urban European American: 33-point asymmetry (anthropocentric). Menominee: 0 (multi-centered). | Variable: Category structure culturally shaped. Not deficit, different organization. |
| Diorama Perspective-Taking | 4 years | Native American rural 88% perspective-taking vs European American 41%. Community teaches perspective. | Variable: Social cognition timing culturally shaped. Earlier development with different practices. |
| Attachment Theory Misapplication | infancy | Aboriginal communal caregiving coded as "neglect" by Western attachment measures. Wrong frame. | Caution: Pathologizing normal variation. Theory ≠ universal; reflects origin culture. |
| Language Acquisition Universal (Saffran, 1996) | 8 months | Statistical learning of transitional probabilities universal. Same mechanism, different input. | Universal: Learning mechanisms shared. Culture provides input, not process. |
| Factory Model vs Indigenous Education (1916; Gawura) | school age | Factory model: "raw products shaped." Gawura (Indigenous-controlled): no achievement gap, Year 5 ≥ state. | Variable: Schooling model matters. Pedagogy not potential explains gaps. |
| Moral-Conventional Distinction (Smetana, 1981; Turiel) | 30 months | Universal distinction at 30mo. But Kohlberg's male-only sample missed care orientation (Gilligan). | Both: Foundations same, emphasis differs. Universal capacity, culturally variable expression. |

## Q9: MORAL DEVELOPMENT TRAJECTORY

- **Philosophical Poles**: HETERONOMOUS MORALITY (Piaget) = rules as external, authority-given, outcome-focused. AUTONOMOUS MORALITY = rules as internal, self-constructed, intention-focused. TRAJECTORY: Rule knowledge (2-3yo) → emotional attribution (4-5yo) → personal binding (8+yo). Shift from outcome-weighting to intention-weighting.

| Concept (Author, Year) | Age/Timing | Description/Quote | Theoretical Position |
|------------------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Moral-Conventional Distinction (Smetana, 1981; Turiel) | 30 months | Children distinguish moral (harm-based, universal) from conventional (rule-based, contextual). Foundation present. | Early: Rule knowledge precedes emotional integration. Know wrong before feel it. |
| Development Paradox | 2.5 years | Know hitting is wrong yet still hit. Knowledge ≠ behavior. Gap = immature impulse control. | Early: Knowing and doing dissociated. Executive function not yet sufficient. |
| Outcome-Weighted Judgment (Heyman & Gelman, 1999) | 4-5 years | Kindergarteners weight outcome 5:1 over intention. Consequence > motive in moral judgment. | Middle: Focus on "what happened" not "why." Heteronomous morality. |
| Happy Victimizer (Nunner-Winkler & Sodian, 1988) | 4-5 years | Predict thief feels "good" (+1.35 rating). Moral knowledge without emotional binding. | Middle: Know rule, don't feel guilt. Cognitive-emotional gap. |
| Emotional Attribution Window (Three-Level Model) | 4-8 years | Level 2 = emotional attribution. Children learn to attribute guilt/pride to moral actors. | Middle: Learning to feel for others. Emotional component developing. |
| Intention-Weighted Judgment (Heyman & Gelman, 1999) | 8+ years | Adults weight intention 4:1 over outcome. Complete reversal from kindergarten. Why > what. | Late: Autonomous morality. Mental states determine moral evaluation. |
| Guilty Victimizer (Nunner-Winkler & Sodian, 1988) | 8 years | Predict thief feels "guilt" (-0.50 rating). 1.85-unit shift over 3 years. Internalized conscience. | Late: Emotional binding to moral rules. Personal identification with morality. |
| Personal Binding / Level 3 | 8+ years | Rules become "mine." Moral identity formed. Critical window closes ~8yo. | Late: Self as moral agent. Rules internalized as personal values. |
| Personality Attribution Persistence | 4-5 vs 7-8 years | Ages 4-5: 3-day trait reset. Ages 7-8: 45-day persistence. "You are what you do." | Late: Stable moral identity. Actions define character. |
| ToM Required for Higher Stages (Kohlberg) | 4+ years | Stages 3-4 (social approval, law and order) require perspective-taking. Pre-conventional does NOT. | Mechanism: ToM enables moral development. Must see others' views for conventional morality. |
| VIM and Moral Circuit (Blair, 1995) | any age | Violence Inhibition Mechanism: distress cues → automatic withdrawal. Psychopathy = impaired VIM. | Mechanism: Affective component of morality. Must feel distress to inhibit harm. |
| Self-Conscious Emotions | 2 years → 8 years | Pride/shame emerge 2yo (need audience). Internalized by 8yo (no audience needed). | Mechanism: Social emotions scaffold moral development. External → internal. |
| Moral Emotion Meta-Analysis (Malti & Krettenauer, 2013) | any age | Moral emotion: r = -0.35 with antisocial, r = +0.20 with prosocial behavior. Feeling predicts doing. | Evidence: Emotional binding matters. Cognition alone insufficient for moral behavior. |

---

## Q10: CRITICAL/SENSITIVE PERIODS

- **Philosophical Poles**: CRITICAL PERIOD (strong) = irreversible window; if missed, capacity permanently absent. SENSITIVE PERIOD (weak) = optimal window; later learning possible but harder/incomplete. PLASTICITY = brain remains modifiable throughout life. EVIDENCE: Language syntax shows critical period; other domains show sensitive periods with varying plasticity.

| Concept (Author, Year) | Age/Timing | Description/Quote | Theoretical Position |
|------------------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Language Syntax Deprivation | <7 years | No sign language exposure before age 7 = permanent syntax deficits. Never catch up. | Critical: Language syntax = true critical period. Early or never. |
| L2 Morphology (Johnson & Newport, 1989) | puberty | L2 acquisition after puberty = never native morphology. Accent, bound morphemes permanently affected. | Critical: Phonemes flexible, grammar not. Different windows for different components. |
| Singleton & Newport Deaf Child (2004) | childhood | Child of 70% accurate parents produces >80% accuracy. Exceeds input quality. | Critical: Critical period for language CREATION. Children improve degraded input. |
| NSL Cohort Effects (Senghas et al., 2004) | childhood | Cohort 1 (adults): 25% componential. Cohort 2 (children): 75%. Children grammaticalize pidgin. | Critical: Children create grammar adults cannot. Window for linguistic innovation. |
| Perceptual Narrowing (Werker & Tees, 1984) | 6-10 months | Lose non-native phoneme contrasts. Reversible with sufficient input. | Sensitive: Optimal window, not absolute. Plasticity remains. |
| HFASD ToM Catch-Up (Scheeren, 2013) | adolescence | No differences by adolescence. Delay not deficit. Alternative route works eventually. | Sensitive: Some capacities have longer windows. Not all delays permanent. |
| Personality Window (Trait Attribution) | 4-8 years | 3-day reset at 4-5yo. 45-day persistence at 7-8yo. Moral identity crystallizes. | Sensitive: Character formation window. Later change harder. |
| Quebec Ice Storm Epigenetics (1998) | prenatal | Prenatal stress → methylation changes persisting 10+ years. Prenatal = critical for epigenetic programming. | Critical: Experience writes on genome. Timing determines permanence. |
| Farah SES Brain Development (2006) | birth → 12 years | Same brains at birth. Poverty → smaller hippocampus, thinner PFC by age 12. | Sensitive: Environment shapes brain. Early adversity has lasting effects. |
| Diamond Tools of Mind (2007) | 3-5 years | Intervention raises EF from 50% to 72%. Trainable if timed right. | Plasticity: Critical period doesn't mean no intervention. Window for training. |
| PFC Late Maturation | 16-25 years | DLPFC functional by 16-18. VMPFC continues to 25. Extended window. | Plasticity: Late maturation = prolonged plasticity. Adolescent brain still developing. |
| Expertise Sparing (Go Experts) | elderly | Game-specific WM: no decline. Novel game: significant decline. Expertise = chunking. | Plasticity: Practice within domain preserves function. Use it or lose it. |
| Sticky Mittens (Needham, 2002) | 3-4 months | Velcro mittens enable reaching before natural age → accelerated object knowledge. | Plasticity: Window open for acceleration. Motor → cognitive cascade. |
| Visual Cliff (Campos et al.) | 6-9 months | Crawling required for depth fear. Pre-crawlers no avoidance. Experience creates fear. | Experience-expectant: Window waits for specific experience. Not time-locked. |
| CU Treatment Efficacy by Age | <7 vs >7 years | CU <7yo: 50-70% response. CU >7yo: 30-40%. Earlier = more malleable. | Sensitive: Treatment windows exist. Earlier intervention, better outcomes. |
| Fast Track Orchid Response | childhood | Orchids: massive response if early intervention. Dandelions: flat regardless. | Individual differences: Susceptibility determines window. Not all children same plasticity. |
