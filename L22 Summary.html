        <h2>Comprehensive Summary</h2>
        <div class="summary-text">
            <span class="key-concepts">Language acquisition is not passive absorption but active structural discovery</span>, wherein infants transform continuous acoustic signals into <span class="key-concepts">hierarchical, rule-governed symbolic systems through componentiality (finite primitives: ~40 phonemes, ~20,000 words) and compositionality (finite combination rules: phonotactics, syntax, discourse coherence)</span> that paradoxically enable infinite expressive capacity because <span class="key-concepts">constraints create contrastive structure</span>—if any sound could follow any sound, listeners could extract no regularities; if any word order were equivalent, syntax could convey no relational meaning ("dog bites man" ≠ "man bites dog")—making combinatorial explosion possible precisely because rules filter chaos into structured meaning across hierarchical levels where phonemes assemble into syllables, syllables into morphemes, morphemes into words, words into sentences, sentences into discourses. <span class="phonology">Newborns arrive with preferences but not biases</span>, demonstrated by <span class="evidence">high-amplitude sucking studies (Vouloumanos & Werker, 2004) showing newborns suck faster for speech versus acoustically complex non-speech</span> and recognize native language prosody heard in utero, yet during the <span class="phonology">first six months infants exhibit categorical perception across all world languages</span>—<span class="evidence">English-learning and Japanese-learning 6-month-olds both discriminate /r/ from /l/ (English contrast) and retroflex /ɖ/ from dental /d̪/ (Hindi contrast)</span>—but by <span class="evidence">10 months</span>, before producing first words, infants undergo <span class="key-concepts">perceptual narrowing</span> where <span class="evidence">Japanese 10-month-olds no longer discriminate /r/ vs. /l/ and English 10-month-olds no longer discriminate Hindi dental vs. retroflex stops</span>, reflecting not cognitive decline but <span class="key-concepts">learned attention allocation driven by distributional statistics</span>—collapsing irrelevant acoustic variance into functional categories frees resources for word learning while bilingual infants maintain sensitivity to contrasts in both languages as appropriate environmental tuning. <span class="phonology">Categorical perception</span> operates through <span class="key-concepts">voice onset time (VOT)</span> mechanisms where <span class="evidence">physically equal acoustic steps produce perceptual inequality: 0ms vs. 20ms VOT (both heard as /d/) show poor discrimination, while 20ms vs. 40ms (across the /d/-/t/ boundary) show excellent discrimination</span>, with <span class="evidence">Eimas et al. (1971) demonstrating 2-day-old infants already perceive categorical boundaries at adult-like locations for both native and non-native contrasts through habituation paradigms</span>, establishing that categorical perception machinery is present from birth but undergoes <span class="phonology">adaptive specialization by 10 months</span> enabling efficient word learning. <span class="phonology">Speech segmentation</span> solves the problem that fluent speech contains <span class="key-concepts">no consistent silence marking word boundaries</span>—acoustic analysis reveals pauses occur within words ("ba-by") as often as between them—forcing infants to parse continuous streams like /ðəbeɪbiɪzslipɪŋ/ into units /ðə/ + /beɪbi/ + /ɪz/ + /slipɪŋ/ through <span class="phonology">multiple probabilistic cues</span>: <span class="evidence">(1) prosodic stress patterns where English words typically have single primary stress syllable (Gambell & Yang, 2003) with consecutive stressed syllables likely signaling word boundaries</span>, <span class="evidence">(2) phonotactic constraints where sound sequences like /st/ are legal word-initially but /df/ is not</span>, and <span class="evidence">(3) transitional probabilities where within-word syllable pairs have high conditional probability (P(by|ba) high in "baby") while cross-boundary probabilities drop</span>, with infants sensitive to all these cues by 8 months, though segmentation is language-specific because stress-based strategies work for stress-timed languages like English and Dutch but fail for syllable-timed languages like French (phrase-final stress, not word-level) requiring greater reliance on phonotactic cues and function word detection. The <span class="word-learning">vocabulary explosion begins around 18 months (from ~50 words at 18 months to 5,000–20,000 by age 7), averaging one new word per waking hour at peak</span>, ruling out simple associative learning due to <span class="key-concepts">Quine's gavagai problem</span>—when an adult points at a rabbit and says "gavagai," the word could refer to rabbit, ears, hopping, whiteness, or undetached rabbit parts—which infants solve through <span class="word-learning">social-pragmatic constraints</span> assuming speakers are helpful communicators: <span class="evidence">(1) referential intent tracking where 12-month-olds follow gaze direction to identify speaker's target, prioritizing looked-at objects over equally salient alternatives</span>, <span class="evidence">(2) mutual exclusivity where hearing novel word "dax" with familiar object (fork) and unfamiliar object (garlic press) produces 95% selection of unfamiliar object (Markman; Wilson & Katsos, 2021)</span> through pragmatic inference that if the speaker intended the familiar object they would have used its known label, <span class="evidence">(3) shape bias where new object labels extend by shape for count nouns referring to solid objects</span> but <span class="word-learning">comparison overrides shape bias</span> as demonstrated by <span class="evidence">Graham et al. (2020) showing children generalize by texture instead of shape when shown two exemplars with shared texture</span>, and <span class="evidence">(4) pedagogical sampling (Xu & Tenenbaum, 2007) where showing three Dalmatians yields subordinate inference ("dax" = Dalmatian), showing three different dog breeds yields basic-level inference ("dax" = dog), and showing dog/cat/bird yields superordinate inference ("dax" = animal)</span> through <span class="key-concepts">Bayesian pedagogical reasoning</span> where children assume teachers choose examples to be maximally informative about category boundaries following the formula <em>level of generality ∝ variation within examples / variation outside examples</em>. At <span class="morphosyntax">18 months children begin producing two-word combinations</span> that are not random truncations but <span class="morphosyntax">systematic compressions preserving word order</span>: "Daddy went to work" becomes "Daddy work" not "*work Daddy," showing early sensitivity to syntax despite production limitations, progressing by <span class="morphosyntax">24–36 months to master inflectional morphology (plural -s, past tense -ed, progressive -ing)</span> and demonstrating <span class="key-concepts">productive mastery</span> through the <span class="evidence">famous wug test (Berko, 1958) where children reliably produce "wugs" (/wʌgz/) for "This is a wug. Now there are two of them. There are two ___?"</span>, proving extraction of abstract rule <code>NOUN + -s → PLURAL</code> with correct <span class="morphosyntax">allomorph selection</span> (/-s/ after voiceless consonants in "cats" /kæts/, /-z/ after voiced consonants in "dogs" /dɔgz/ and "wugs" /wʌgz/, /-ɪz/ after sibilants in "buses" /bʌsɪz/), exemplifying <span class="key-concepts">U-shaped developmental trajectory</span>: <span class="morphosyntax">(1) young children correctly produce irregular forms like "feet" and "teeth" through imitation, (2) upon discovering regular plural rule they overgeneralize producing "foots" and "tooths," (3) eventually re-learning that some forms are lexical exceptions while maintaining productive rule for regular nouns</span>—this U-shape (correct → error → correct) is diagnostic of rule learning not rote memorization, with overgeneralization errors revealing cognitively sophisticated prioritization of productive generalizations applying to 99% of English nouns over memorized exceptions, ultimately demonstrating children maintain both productive default and lexically-specified exceptions in a dual-route model. <span class="pragmatics">Pragmatic development</span> governs <span class="key-concepts">appropriateness not grammaticality</span>—"Could you pass the salt?" is grammatically a yes/no question but pragmatically an indirect request where responding "Yes, I could" without passing salt is infelicitous because it ignores communicative intent—with children not mastering these conventions until <span class="evidence">6–8 years</span>, well after basic syntax and vocabulary, because <span class="pragmatics">non-literal language (metaphor "time is money," idiom "kicked the bucket," irony, sarcasm) requires metarepresentational theory of mind</span>: the listener must represent not just the speaker's mental state but <span class="key-concepts">speaker's intention to communicate a belief different from surface meaning</span>, explaining why <span class="pragmatics">children with ASD often show intact phonology, vocabulary, and syntax but struggle with pragmatics precisely due to difficulty with higher-order mental state attributions</span>, with pragmatic competence continuing into adulthood as individuals learn register variation (formal vs. informal), politeness conventions, and culturally-specific norms. <span class="key-concepts">Language creation</span> reveals children as <span class="key-concepts">active regularizers not passive absorbers</span>: <span class="evidence">deaf children forming communities (Nicaraguan Sign Language emerging 1980s) create fully grammatical sign language within one generation complete with phonology, morphology, and syntax</span>, while <span class="evidence">Singleton & Newport (2004) documented deaf child whose hearing parents used sign morphology correctly only ~70% of the time but child's signing showed >80% correct morpheme use, exceeding input quality</span> through <span class="key-concepts">filtering noise and amplifying signal</span>, with <span class="evidence">Hudson Kam & Newport (2005) artificial language studies showing adults exposed to 60% determiner consistency reproduced ~60% usage while ~70% of children regularized into systematic users either always using determiners (grammaticalizing as obligatory) or always omitting them (treating as absent) rather than reproducing probabilistic patterns</span>, demonstrating <span class="key-concepts">regularization tendency stronger in children than adults</span> with critical threshold where regularization is strongest when input variability is moderate (60%–80% consistency) but struggles below 40% consistency, explaining how children exposed to pidgins (minimal grammars used by adult second-language learners) transform them into creoles (full grammars) in a single generation by imposing structure not present in input, ultimately establishing that language acquisition proceeds through <span class="key-concepts">active hypothesis-testing imposing structure on noisy data</span> where perceptual narrowing by 10 months adaptively tunes phonetic space to functionally relevant contrasts freeing cognitive resources, segmentation mechanisms deploy language-specific strategies tuned to prosodic regularities of ambient input enabling word extraction, social-pragmatic constraints (gaze following, mutual exclusivity, pedagogical sampling, comparison) narrow referential ambiguity through convergent multi-cue integration solving Quine's gavagai problem, productive morphosyntactic rule learning enables grammatical generalization demonstrated by wug test performance and U-shaped overgeneralization patterns, pragmatic mastery requiring metarepresentational theory of mind emerges 6–8 years for non-literal language comprehension, and language creation through active regularization (exemplified by Nicaraguan Sign Language and artificial language learning studies) reveals children as structure-seeking agents who extract abstract rules from finite input enabling infinite generativity, collectively demonstrating that language development is not passive environmental imprinting but active structural discovery combining domain-general learning mechanisms (statistical sensitivity, social inference) with domain-specific constraints (universal phonetic categories, hierarchical compositional architecture) to transform acoustic streams into symbolic systems supporting thought and communication.
