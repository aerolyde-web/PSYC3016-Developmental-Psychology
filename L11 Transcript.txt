Alright everybody, it is 50, so we will get going. Uh, I'm guessing there are a few more of you still to come, we look a bit empty, um. You've all thrown me today because typically, I don't know if you're aware of this, you all sit in exactly the same place every lecture, so I know where everybody is. And some weird people in people, funny places, so you've all thrown me, very naughty. Um, OK, so typically, I mean, everything else in this course, we've been talking about um infancy, we're talking about early childhood, with the exception of maybe moral development where we go into adulthood. We don't really spend any time looking at adolescents. So a few years ago, Mike and I decided that we would add one in. So we'd add a whole lecture in on adolescent development as a kind of slightly stand-alone piece, OK? So Um, here are your learning outcomes for adolescent development. Um, I won't bother spending time on those right now. Here's what we'll do. Um, first of all, let's think about how we actually define adolescence. So it's typically divided into three stages. So we have early adolescence, as it says they're 10 to 15 approximately. Um, this is the kind of, if you think of adolescent a bit like a kind of, uh, what's the best way to think about it, like a kind of upside down. Bucket, but like a U curve, but not um. This first stage is, is kind of things are quite rapid. So the kind of rapid growth and development of secondary sexual characteristics, that's all happening then. Um, so things changing with body image, mood, um. Things become intense, friendships are intense, exploration of sexuality, so it's kind of like the kind of uh beginning flourish, if you know, see what I mean, of adolescence, the first part. Then the middle part might be the bit that you most kind of stereotypically imagine when you think about adolescence. So, Things to do with risky behavior, arguing with authority, um, spending more time with peers, um, would be the kind of maybe the not so much negative, but the kind of stereotypical things that you think about related to, um, middle adolescence. But there's also kind of some positives. Um, this is when the brain growth is occurring, particularly the prefrontal cortex. We'll look at that in a minute. Um. And the beginning of a more stable relationships, particularly friendships. So adolescence is really is interesting, right? In fact, friendships across childhood are really interesting and that they really fluctuate how they function across across age. Um, so, That early stage where it's a 10 to 15, and it talks about intense friendships. If you think back to year maybe I'm gonna say 78. Maybe 6678, those years of uh end of primary, beginning of secondary. How many of you remember the kind of like, um, Intense, we're best friends, we hate each other, we're best friends, we hate each other, that kind of rocky friendships, right? That's quite typical of that, of that stage, because they're intense, right? And but you're also developing, you're both developing very quickly in different ways. Whereas when we get to middle adolescence, we start to see those stabilizing, right, that, that kind of drama, if you like, tends to dissipate slightly. And then by the time we get to late adolescence, um, here that all the physical changes have typically, uh, if not finished, they're almost finished. The ability to think more abstractly, um, the frontal cortex is far more developed, um, and you start to see the kind of adults, behavior, adult relationships, particularly with family start to develop. And And yeah, you're you're representing a kind of functional adult form. That's not to say adolescents aren't functional, but it's, it's going through society as an adult, OK. Less influence of peers, um, and individual friendships and relationships become most, most important, as you might expect. Notice that there's quite a large overlap. OK, 10 to 1514 to 1716 to 19. So these aren't, you know, categorical done by age. Um, this is more, it's more a kind of generic definition. Something that's quite interesting to look at is the changes in the definition of the changes in what we expect between 100 years ago and now. So there's a picture of some adolescents in the 1920s. Um, puberty onset in the 1920s was about 14.5. For girls, it's 10.5 for girls now. This is puberty onset, right, it's the beginning of the whole process, not just, um. Your periods, OK? Interestingly, we also left school at around the age of 14. This is UK data in the 1920s, we now leave school at around 1718 in Australia. You could be employed full-time at the age of 14, in the 1920s, um, now you have to wait. Until you are 1718, etc. Interestingly, teenage pregnancy rates were approximately the same. So 100 years ago, about 2.5%. Of pregnancies were teenage pregnancies compared to 2.8% now. Does that make sense? Yeah. Well, 2020. Mm. Yeah. Does it make sense? Why does it make sense? Because considering that Behavior 100 years ago might have been quite different. So two things happened since the 1920s and now, 2020s. 2 massive cultural things have happened. Yeah, Yes, number one, contraception, birth control. So that's on one side, that is reducing teenage pregnancies, right? What's the other thing that happened? What? No, not the internet, before that, yeah. Uh, I don't know if that's changed. I think it might be stable, yeah. The sexual revolution, right? So you'd expect between now and between the 1920s and now, there should have been a massive increase in teenage pregnancies. You have the sexual revolution, um, it was much more common, the idea of having sex outside of marriage, blah blah blah blah blah. Um, but then at the same time you have contraception, you have birth control. OK, so. What is interesting though, and you haven't had the tutorial on this yet, unless it was the first one. No, I don't think it was. Um. You will have a tutorial on, um, kind of adolescent offending at some point. It's quite good. One of the points that's made is Look at how these numbers match up. In the 1920s, these numbers were all the same number, OK? A child was considered ready to leave school and start full-time employment at the same time as they entered puberty. Now we have puberty starting much earlier, but we're also delaying the age of quote unquote responsibility, so school leaving age and employment. So what this generates is a massive gap. It's a very big seven year ish gap between the age at which a child begins the process of effectively becoming an adult. And when they are socially allowed to do that. And what we'll see in that tutorial is that that gap, that maturity gap, if you like, um, puts quite a lot of strain on. Adolescents, OK. Particularly in the case of offending where a lot of adolescent offending behavior or antisocial behavior is considered to be in some ways a response to this, right? So you've got teenagers wanting to be seen as an adult, wanting to be seen as responsible, as capable, as having respect, blah, blah, blah blah, but they're in a societal situation where they don't get that because they're not perceived capable of getting that. So if you offend, if you become, you know, Leader of a gang, you get that to some extent from your peers, OK, so it's one of the major theories of adolescent offending. It's also why adolescent offending is limited. OK, we're going to spend a little bit of time looking at the basic, uh, kind of timeline of, first of all, the physical changes of adolescence. Interesting that people are meant to do this at at like high school, but the more and more people I talk to, there'll be some reason why you didn't cover this in high school. And I think that's, do you know what I mean? It's like either the sex education class was canceled, my teacher had a hysterectomy when I when we went to have sex education. I was like all these things kind of happen and people miss out on this stuff. So we're gonna cover it anyway. So, uh, very stereotypically, pink is for girls, blue is for boys. So what you notice first of all is that the beginning of the kind of physical biological changes, um, of adolescence become earlier for girls than they do for boys. OK, it's around 10 1.5 versus 11.5. Boys continue growing for longer. If you're interested, wisdom teeth don't start till much later in this process. And growth spurts, um, For girls around the age of 12 they peak around the age of 12, around the age of 14 for boys. So there's already a kind of disparity between um Boys and girls in terms of the kind of process and stages through puberty. OK. So for girls, the beginning part when we're talking about these big kind of body changes, it's mainly the ones that you would be aware of, right? So breast changes, changes in body shape and height, right? So often little girls go from being kind of uh small and quite straight up and down, and they develop those kind of curves you associate with an adult, more adult body. Obviously individual difference means there's a huge variation in that. Growth of pubic and body hair and the start of periods, menstruation. I think there's something a bit unfair when we compare boys and girls in that we often say that, um, and it is, but for a girl starting periods can be a very kind of confronting thing. It's a very new thing. The body's doing something it's never done before, right? So it's a very, you know, strange thing. Um, I think fewer people are aware that for boys, erections now come with ejaculation. Right, which is also a different thing and can be a confronting thing for some young men, OK? So there, there are multiple different ways in which the bodies change. Um, obviously growth, uh, in everything, including the secondary sexual characteristics, and then changes to voice and that kind of thing. It's worth noting that the increases in the growth changes that happen here, so these growth spurts at 12 and 14, it's not just height, it's also weight, heart and lung size. So you kind of vital organs are growing as well, muscular strength, um, so very, very big changes, particularly see in males more easily, huge changes in the kind of uh Type of muscle that's present on the body, right? They go from little, little boys to suddenly the muscle um distribution for some men, um, of an older man. What you might have noticed as well is that, or you might remember this, right? How many of you, you don't have to say, but how many of you remember going through that stage of adolescence when you were kind of a bit. What's the word, uncoordinated. Right, you went, yeah, you went through a stage where it's like you try to move your limbs and they weren't really doing what you wanted. It's because of this. It's because often the bone growth is faster than the muscle development, right? So throughout your childhood, you're developing proprioception, right, which is when your brain basically knows, if you reach out and grab something, right, it knows exactly how long your bones are. It knows, right? Because it's learned. If you have really, really rapid growth, particularly of bones more than muscle, your brain doesn't know anymore. Right, your brain hasn't caught up, it hasn't had long enough to realize that your arm's not this long, right? So it's why often they go through a clumsy phase. You know, the phase of knocking things over, falling over. There's nothing wrong with you, it's just you you're growing really fast. And that's also why quite genuinely there is, there are genuine increases in appetite and um sleep requirements in adolescents, OK, because the bodies are going through such dramatic changes really, really fast. And there's also a kind of social consequence here. I always worry, right, every year I worry that someone in this photo is going to be in this room. Right? Um, I didn't choose it from New South Wales, it's somewhere else, it's freely available on the internet. If you are in this photo, I do apologize. Um, all I'm pointing out is I think it's actually a year 9 group photo, cause I looked it up again today to check cause I'm always surprised. Um, but this is a group of, um, boys in the middle of adolescence, so year, year 9, let's say year 9, year 10. Um, approximately the same age. Now, obviously in Australia, you can have a 1.5 year age difference in the same year if you're at maximum the minimum of the age requirements. But still, what you notice is that because people go through puberty and the physical changes of puberty at different stages, you've got in the same class, boys that look like little boys, right, they could pass for 10, just from this photo, you know, and boys that could pass for men. In the same class. Now just think about that for a minute in terms of social, um, how that works socially, because you might say it's not, it's really hard on these, on these boys, right? Because these ones can probably get away with, you know, doing more stuff, they might get more respect from other members of the class because they're bigger, or they might, they might be skilled in sport where these younger ones are not because they haven't got the physical strength, right? At the same time, and don't forget this, at the same time, these kids might come home and go, hey, you know what, we're just going to go and play Minecraft together. Right? Maybe these boys want to as well. But that's less accepted because they look like they're men. Right? So there's, there's kind of two sides to the social implications of, of either developing early or developing late. You see the same thing for girls, right? So girls that develop, um, physically early, um, that, you know, they're now facing the way society views someone who looks like a woman, and they may not be emotionally ready for that. They might, they might be interest from, um, Other members of the class, male or female, and they may not be ready for that. OK, so it's got their bodies signifying something that maybe they're not ready for. Similarly, the girls that don't develop that develop later, they may feel like there's something wrong with them. They feel like they're left out. You know, so it's such a kind of fraught time purely based on if you, if you base it on nothing else other than body development. OK Another thing that's worth noting is that since the 1920s, um, obesity or child obesity in Australia has very dramatically increased. I think about 1 in 4 children in Australia are now considered overweight or obese. So, um. The reason this is important is because at the same time we've noticed that um puberty or beginning menstruation, particularly has got earlier and earlier. So the question became, and it was recognized that there was a relationship, so studies had shown that girls who were significantly overweight were more likely to have started their periods earlier than girls that weren't, right? So but then it could go either way. It's a correlation, right? So it could be that there's something causing both them to be more likely to, to gain weight and to start their periods at the same time, right? It might not be a causal relationship, it might be something else. Um, it might be that starting puberty earlier means it's easier to gain weight. I didn't know. So what this study that's referenced here did is it followed 354 girls who were either normal weight, at risk of being overweight, or overweight from age 3 to 11. And by doing that, by doing a longitudinal study, what they were able to do was say which came first. And what they did find was that um there was quite a clear relationship between increased body fat um causing early onset of puberty. OK, and not the other way around. If you think about it, it's kind of from an evolutionary perspective, any mammal won't um reproduce if it's his body's not capable of doing so, right? So if you have, you know, um, People who are very underweight, for example, often those um periods will stop. Yeah, so a female who's very underweight, those periods will stop the body's saying there's not enough. Energy in here to produce a baby, right? And the opposite seems to be true as well. So overweight, it's like almost like the brain goes, you're, you're ready, right, the BMI is there, it's not calculating where. You know, where the mass is, um, it's just somehow calculating that it's, it's ready to go. So how do you measure this, and this is actually an important point, right? If you ever want to work with adolescents in the future, certainly in any kind of medical capacity, how on earth, it's such a sensitive question. Such a sensitive question to these kids, you know. They're 10 to 17. It's a really sensitive time for loads of different reasons. How do you ask the question? How do you get a decent understanding of where they are in terms of biological pubertal maturation? So they use something called the Tanner scale, which are these little scales here, and they have very basic pictures as shown of the main characteristics that change through different stages of puberty. So they have Tanner scale 1 to 5. And effectively what they'd asked. Depending on the age, actually what they'd ask probably the adolescent to do is to indicate where they thought they were on that scale, right? So there's no, no, yeah. I don't know, I don't think it's done in schools. No, no, no. And it'd be more like a medical thing, right? So there are some, you know, that I'm not obviously not, not a medical doctor, but I am aware there are some, you know, medical conditions that may present differently depending on the stage of. Puberty or, you know, full development. You might also want to know, you know, if a child's got behavioral, emotional issues, you know, have they started puberty yet? You know, or are they in precocious puberty, you know, because those things can be indicative of of other factors as well. Oh really? Really, really interesting. Sorry, that was, that was a comment saying that, was it Vietnam? So in Vietnam, so did you do this privately? No. So what, hang on, what did you, I need to know this. What did you know? What did you do? Oh, really? So they checked your stage of. A general checkup, OK, and that was standard, so everyone kind of expected it. OK, I don't, that doesn't happen here, does it? No, no, um, no, but neither anyway, um. Um. So this is just another comparison, we won't spend much time on this, but just to show you, they're on top of each other now. Um, so these are girls and these are boys. OK, just so you can see the slight differences, the slight shift in um when these different tanner stages are occurring. OK, so you could have a girl who's kind of 1314, who's in the final stages of puberty physically, um, in the same class as a boy who may not have quite got there yet in terms of certainly in terms of growth, um, and other measures. OK. OK, this is always an interesting one. So when, that's the physical changes, the kind of obvious bodily changes. Underneath that, of course, there are quite significant hormonal changes. That's why these body changes occur, right? So here's a figure, and I think it's quite, just look at it for a minute. I know this, the the scale on the left is not the most informative. It says low, and then it says high, right? It's not the most informative. Um, what it's trying to show you is the steepness of that curve from age kind of 1012 to 1416, the increase in testosterone. You can get a better understanding by looking over here. This is from an endocrinology textbook. Um, this is boys aged 10 to 11 years old. Whether you look at total or free testosterone doesn't really matter. If you look at total 10 to 11 years old, they're ranging 5 to 50 nanograms per deciliter. By the time they're 12 to 14, that can for some has 10-fold. For some it's a 10-fold increase in testosterone. Um, but those at the lower end of the range, again, obviously there's differences, right? People will do this at different stages. Um. And then you've got 15 to 17 year olds, you've got 220 to 800. So between there and there, you're looking at huge, huge, huge, huge, huge increase in the amount of testosterone. How many of you have heard of the testosterone spike in like 3 to 4 year olds, the kind of uh toddler testosterone spike? Yeah, totally untrue. There is no evidence that the testosterone spike yet. What happened was there was one bit of research done. And it kind of prematurely suggested, it didn't even say actually to be fair to them, I think it's just suggested that there might be a testosterone boost in kind of age 3 to 4. And someone who wrote a book took that and ran with it, um, and I think it just kind of piqued everyone's interest and went, oh, this is interesting. There must be a testosterone spike, and there was no evidence for one. So the reason that 3 to 4 year old boys are quite tricky is because they're going through cognitive changes, basically. They want more autonomy, they want more choice, um, they're better at doing stuff, they're capable of doing more stuff. It's all kind of those things that often end up in temper tantes. No. Basically the only time there's any testosterone, significant changes in uh. The lifespan of a male is prenatally to about 6 months after birth. Right? So that range, there's um kind of uh there's a lot prenatally that does stuff and then it's about 6 months afterwards, it's there. Obviously, there's higher amounts than than females, right? It's obviously more, but there's not an increase in in in at any point during there until you get to adolescence. Yeah. Age of onset of puberty. Um. Stra answer probably yes, everything does. Um, yeah, so for example, you might find in the same family that if the mum or the dad, for example, went early, you might find you might. Expect maybe the children to do the same, absolutely, um, all the kind of physical changes are related to hormones, so it's whenever those hormones kind of get turned on and that is generally genetic, I think, but with that environmental factor, right, so look at obesity, that'll turn it on way faster. Yeah, so it's again, like everything, it's kind of a combo. Uh, for females, this one here is the growth hormone. So this is why you get that big growth spurt in females starting around the age of or peaking around the age of 12, gradually declining, um, depending on which site, which book you're citing. These, all these ones here, every single one of these ones here is all to do with the menstrual cycle. OK. So again, what you might not be fully aware of is that it's not that when a girl starts her periods at age 1213, whatever it is, and there's a range, right, could be 1415, when they start, it's suddenly like poof. All the hormones are there and they're all fully working, they're all doing great stuff. That doesn't happen. It is, uh, almost opposite actually to the boys who kind of comes on very quickly. But the girls, um, it can take 345 years before those hormones have figured out what they should be doing, right? So they're like wobbling all over the place. Um, until they kind of reach adulthood, and that tends to be hopefully where they stabilize, right, but it can take many, many, many, many years. OK, so here's what's known about um Kind of the kind of cognitive changes from adolescence, so individuals become more capable of abstract, multidimensional, planned and hypothetical thinking as they develop from late childhood into adolescence, right? We know that, we have data on that. Which is great But Whereas studies of people's responses to hypothetical dilemmas involving the perception and appraisal of risk show few reliable age differences after middle adolescence, so hold on to that for a minute. So, up to the age of about 1415, after that point, There are no real differences in experimental tasks involving hypothetical dilemmas of perception and risk. OK, people perform exactly the same. However, When you look at actual risk taking, or what people are actually doing, um, adolescents are significantly more likely to make risky decisions than adults. OK? So there's this kind of slight disconnect where Kind of during mid-adolescence, we know that these people are capable of making Decisions in the same way adults would, right? But they don't do it. In real life. So what's going on? First of all, let's look at what are the cognitive changes in adolescence. So we've kind of looked at the physical changes and the hormonal changes, right? I want you to hold them on one side for a minute. Because I'm gonna give you a, a kind of important hint. They are related to hormones. They are hormonally driven, right? The physical changes um are related to the hormone changes. Cognitive changes are changes in brain structure with age. So the cognitive changes of adolescence are chronological, basically. OK, now there will be individual differences just like for everything else, but they are based on the age of the individual, right? And they're mostly in the area of executive functions, specifically things like deductive reasoning and information processing, including social information processing. Yeah OK, so let's have a look. You do not need to worry too much about this. Obviously read that in your own time. If you want to, I'm going to take it, take you through these little figures. All it's really showing you is results from a study that looked at multiple different measures of things to do with executive function. So working memory and planning, generally indicative of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex function. And in a minute, we'll look at calibration of risk and reward, um, which is indicative of ventromedial prefrontal cortex. By the way, the Iowa gambling task, which is used here is a thing that's used a lot. It does. There are some criticisms of this task. But don't worry about them for that for now, OK? So over here, for example, um, these columns over here are to do with suppression of reflexive circade. So a circade is when your eyes move somewhere reflexively, right? And the suppression of that is when you kind of top down, um, decide not to do that, right? So it's kind of impulse control, really. And these errors here demonstrate it most nicely is that from the age of kind of 6 to 89 to 11, all the way to 23, 29, um, what you see generally apart from a little blip there is a decrease in the errors, anti-scicade errors, right? So they're getting better at controlling kind of. Things that they don't want to do. Basically, right, they're told not to make a cicade, and they're getting better at not doing that. This is the stroop task. So this is um kind of uh the lower the score, the better the accuracy, basically. So again, it's executive function, it's being able to inhibit one thing and manage what the other one. This is stop signal reaction time. So again, inhibitory control really ability to stop. This one's also quite interesting because this is verbal fluency and nonverbal fluency. So that is effectively the ability to generate multiple of of a. Category, right? So if I said to you, I want you to name as many farm animals as you can in one minute. That's what verbal fluency is. OK, we've one example. And again, as you see, so forget the younger ages, but from 1012, 13, there's a slight, but it's consistent increase in the verbal fluency. So it's again, it's kind of that control. It's your brain's control over itself, really. So great. So that's increasing. We're getting better at that. OK, that's a good sign. Uh, when you look at the Iowa gambling task, which is about managing risk and reward, OK, it's about going, um, Can I kind of figure out what's the best behavior to do in this situation? And the way it works is this, there are 4 decks of cards, right? A, B, C, and D. Now 2 of these decks, so C and D, for example, are actually advantageous. So if you pick from C or D, every time you pick from C or D, you get 50 bucks. Not really, right? Just like 50 pretend bucks. 50 cents, say, right, but you get 50 bucks, that's what you win, but. 1 out of every 2 choices from C, C, you will lose 50 bucks. So if you press C twice, Right? You generally end up with like 50 bucks. OK, because you'd win 50 bucks one turn. The next turn you'd win 50 bucks, but you'd also lose 50 bucks. OK, so it's advantageous, but only 50 bucks. D is actually the same in that you win 50 bucks every time you press it, but once every 10 times you press it, you lose 250 bucks. OK, so you'd win 250 bucks over. 10 presses. That makes sense. So these ones are advantageous, however, A and B are slightly more appealing because you win 100 bucks. So imagine if you've come across this task for the first time, and you pressed A, B, C, and D, you might be like, oh, A and B are great, because they give me more money. Correct, however, If you press B, 1 in every 2 presses you can lose 250 bucks, so you end up at a loss, right, minus 50 bucks. Same with this one. So despite the fact that it occurs rarely, once in every 10 presses you win 1250 bucks. OK. So again, you were down 250 bucks. So basically you're, you're allowed to press the buttons however way you want over a certain number of trials, um, and the idea is that you're meant to learn that these are the ones you should be pressing. That's what you're meant to learn. If you test children, they'll generally press equally from good and bad decks. They can't figure it out. OK. Um, it's a harder task than it seems, right? Because it's hard to memorize. It could be a cognitive load. Well, it is, right, cognitive, or executive function is managing cognitive load. Um. 10 to 15 year olds, so kind of early to mid adolescence, um, they did get better over time. So they were beginning to show that they were starting to get it. By the final blocks, they were drawing from the good decks about 55 to 60% of the time. By the time you get to 18 to 25 year olds, so end of adolescence, they are drawing from the good deck nearly 75% of the time by the last block. OK? So there's evidence, at least from this task, at least in this study. That's a caveat in the study, um, that this form of executive function is also getting better over time. OK, so what is going on in terms of brain? It's basically increased efficiency, that's it, really. The, the brain is becoming more efficient. It's doing that by increasing myelination so that, you know, remember the myelin is like the little kind of like electrical sheath around the neuron. Yes, exactly the same as an electric wire with a little plastic bit, um, and it increases the um efficiency basically decreases the efficiency of the firing. And synaptic pruning, so. It's so much like gardening, so much of like psychology is like gardening. Oh, you want a thing to grow strong and, you know, well, you cut it down. Yeah, you cut it back, you cut off the bits that you don't want to grow, like tomato plants, right? How, how many of you growing tomatoes? It is tomato season. You've got to get a tomato, they grow really well, grow really well in, um, milk crates on balconies, by the way, if any of you are in apartments. Trust me, really well. Um, you've gotta pick out the little new ones coming through, otherwise what you end up with is an incredibly bushy tomato plant with like 3 tomatoes on it, cause the things just keep growing, right? So you've got to pinch out the new bits of tomato plant that are growing between the branches, otherwise it won't, it won't give any fruit, OK? So what this little thing is showing here, we don't need to spend too much. You don't need to know all the minute details of this, by the way, either. What I want you to understand is which approximate areas are changing and how they're changing, OK? So they're becoming more myelinated, um, and there's localization of synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex. OK. Um, what is quite interesting is that um These are age-related changes in white matter density, OK, along the frontotemporal and the occipitotemporal pathways. Children aged 10 to 19 years, OK, and they're scanned twice, so it's, it's changes within the subject. What is quite interesting is that if you look over here, um, This kind of pathway here is also related to identification of um biological motion. Which becomes important in a minute. Um, so activations of regions along the left superior temporal sulcus during the perception of biological motion by adult subjects. OK, so this pathway is also the one that we know is related to biological motion. Think about what we just talked about in terms of that middle adolescent stage where your friendships are like, ah. I don't know if that, does that, is that the same for boys, or is it more of a girl thing? More of a girl thing? Who, I don't, I don't know cos I've I've only been one, My girls thing. I mean, obviously, uh, males and females socialize very differently, right? Particularly at high school. Girls tend to do things in kind of groups, um, but a close little little small groups, right? Um, and guys typically tend to do like, you know, a sport, like big group activity, right? So it may well be that there's the context is different. I need, I need a vote. I need a voice. What do you reckon, more of a girl thing? Well, the question, the question was, For guys. Does the friendship, does the kind of the, the, what's turbulence of friendship change across adolescents? Yeah, I've got one nod. We've got some nods. OK, we've got some nods, yay. OK, great. It may be different, it may present itself differently, but there's some kind of turbulence, um. In middle childhood where that's kind of going on. What you've got is development of the part of your brain that is recognizing effectively um. What is meant by Body posture. OK, so we tend to think of children, little kids have having understood and be able to recognize um emotions, etc. That's actually still developing through adolescence. OK, so the ability to recognize emotions, to read other people's emotions is still going on. This figure is incredibly confusing. It's got like a triple negative in it. So I'll, I'll bring you through it, OK? What this is a figure of is we've got age along here. Um, and this is the connectivity between two parts of the brain. OK, so, uh, superior temporal sulcus, which is this bit, um, and the temporoparietal junction, which is basically the cortex, right? So you've got a, this is about the connectivity between cortex, i.e., planning, thinking. Decision making and superior temporal sulcus, which is like, oh, what's that motion mean? Right? It also to do with emotion recognition, face recognition. What you see is that the negative correlation between age. And the and the uh Connectivity between these areas during imagining, imagining scenarios resulting in social relative to basic emotions, right? So what they're asked to do is to imagine social um situations like embarrassment, etc. and also at other times they're asked to imagine um basic emotions, fear, happiness, sadness, etc. OK, so social emotion versus basic emotion. And there's a negative correlation between age and the connectivity between those during um uh these comparing those two social versus basic um imagining scenarios. What you can interpret this is authors say this, an interpretation of the age-related decrease in connectivity. So as they get older, the connectivity decreases. Right? It's kind of opposite to what you might, might think is happening. The connectivity decreases, but again, we're talking about synaptic pruning, things becoming more efficient, right? So the, an interpretation of this decrease in connectivity is that in order to accomplish this task, adolescents require not only higher activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, but also stronger coactivation of the mentalising systems of that superior temporal sulcus than do adults. This may be because the maturing network in adolescence is less efficient in accomplishing the task. Continuing synaptic elimination, so pruning and myelination and perhaps developing axonal caliber during adolescence within regions of the brain involved in mentalising may act to increase the efficiency of the system. So in other words, during adolescence, they're both kind of interfering with each other. And it kind of surmises that middle adolescent period, right? Your decision making part, you're like, this is what's happening, this is how I understand the world part is interfering with and being interfered by the emotion recognition, social part, OK? They're not as efficient on their own yet. Um, So as I was trying to say then that kind of decreased connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system is a good thing. OK, it's more efficient. Um, there's less kind of uh Crosstalk is one way of thinking about it. So think about um. An example of this, right, they give an example of the maturation of the adolescent's ability to extract quickly the relevant cues from the face of a peer. So think of that time where it's really rocky. And when I, I grew up in Essex, right, and there's a phrase in Essex that was very popular, which is like, are you giving me evils? That one, right, which is like some kind of look, to be fair to you, some people were, but um. That's, that's the phrase I want you to think about when you think about this topic, right, because in that stage of adolescence, it's almost like paranoia. Right? It's almost like, did she mean that? What did she say? What did she mean when she said that, like, is she looking at me funny, is she thinking something about me? It's, it's this, right? It's because they haven't extracted the relevant cues from the face of a peer, it's still developing. OK, they're still not very good at it, but at the same time, all other kind of cognitive things are developing. Right? So they're able to have abstract thought. They're able to think, oh, maybe they are thinking about me behind my back, right? Those thought processes are capable. And on the other side, with the hormonal development, you've got someone who's kind of driven by social, um, Status, basically driven by social connectedness, driven by the way in which your peers see you, that's the kind of hormonal part, right? So once those things kind of uh settle out and correct themselves, that kind of fiery part of adolescence hopefully should be, should be got through. So two things are happening as age increases during adolescence. As age increases during adolescence. The neural systems involved in social information processing are becoming more efficient. It's good. The influence of the affective systems, so those parts, la, etc. on the decision making systems is decreasing. Effectively we're becoming slightly more rational. OK. So it's kind of really unfair to say to a mid-addolescent, like you're being irrational, you're being too emotional, they're not, they're being completely what they should be, given the developmental stage of their brain. Right. OK. Impact of the social, I love this one. This is one of my favorite, favorite studies. Um. Here is a study And it Uh, designed to investigate age differences in risk taking. So what they did is they, um, got groups of, um, adults, uh, youths who are kind of 18 to 22, and adolescents 13 to 16. And what they did is, it's a driving game, right? So you can drive the car, and then, um, if you want, aim is to get as far as you can, right? So when the light goes orange, you have a choice. If you want to, you can risk it and just keep going, right? Risk, risk getting a red light, but you can go, OK, to do better in the game. They tested people twice. They tested people on their own. And they tested people with a friend or friends with them, so their peers with them. And the results are really completely brilliant. So here are your adults, whether they're driving alone or with their friends, they behave in exactly the same way. Right? They're just like, oh, yeah, I'll stop, that's fine. Um. By the time you are in the middle, by time you get to adolescence, the number of risky restarts being made by adolescents with their friends is over double the ones they're making when they're by themselves. So that first finding we had, that strange finding where we know that by mid-adolescence, We're capable of making hypothetical, sensible decisions, right, the same way as an adult, and that's shown here, we're totally capable of doing that. Why don't we do it? Because the impact of the social environment is very significant on an adolescent. Not so much on an adult cos you've gone through adolescence, right? It's very significant on um an adolescent. Why? Why is it so important? Well, it's kind of this, it's the hormonal changes. Right, not the cognitive changes. The cognitive changes are the ones why they behave the same way as an adult when they're on their own. The hormonal changes are the reasons that they don't behave the same way when they're with their friends, right? Because the hormonal changes are all to do with these things, arousal, sensation seeking, reward. That's what those hormones are kind of made to do, right? It's just think about it, an animal point of view, right? It's there to make you fitter, it's there to make you more competitive, they're there to make you, you know, function as an adult in the group. And that's what they do to humans, right? Um, and they're very much involved with emotion regulation and response to risk and reward. So that study has shown there demonstrates that response to risk and reward. Um And in terms of emotion regulation, it's quite interesting. So if you look at um parent adolescent conflict, which again is normal. Um, but if you look at the changes in the frequency of parent-child adolescent conflict, um, sorry, parent adolescent conflict. That's related to pubertal maturation far more so than it is to age. So it's related to the hormones, OK, because you've got a teenager who is sensation seeking, right? You're more likely to argue if you're seeking um. Sensation, right? A bit like a skydiver. You're looking for um stimulation, really, reward. Etc. Um, there were no significant correlations, um, there was, sorry, there was no significant correlation between age and sensation seeking in a group of 11 to 14 year olds, but a significant correlation between sensation seeking and pubertal stage. OK, so again, it's showing you the same thing. It's not related to age, this is related to Tanner stage, right, the amount of hormones that are flowing through your body. So there is substantial evidence now that adolescents engage in dangerous activities despite knowing and understanding the risks involved. So you should be seeing how it's all kind of coming together. So that connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and the kind of emotional more social side, um, The cognitive stuff has still developed, right? They know what the risks are. They can, their frontal lobe is doing really well, right? It's just that the other part, both the hormonal part and the part that goes, you know, I can, uh, separate this from my emotions is not there yet. OK, so they're over aroused and they're less able to separate the emotional part from the decision making part. In terms of estrogen and testosterone, so we kind of said this because we were having a chat about the kind of 4 year old um boost that doesn't exist. So testosterone has an effect uh pre and perinatally. So in males, testosterone influences the development of neural circuits, right? Um, the absence of testosterone is what results in the female neural phenotype. OK, so it's the absence of one rather than the presence actually of, of estrogen, um. They're then activated at puberty. Um, and someone's question about, you know, what kind of triggers it? Is it genetic? Um, the steroid hormones act on dormant neural circuits. It sounds a bit like um some kind of alien movie, some kind of dormant neural circuit, but they're basically neural circuits are just unactivated because the levels of hormones aren't there yet. OK. And that's why you do actually see in some kids who do have like, um, there are certain conditions which cause these hormones to be off, um, and of the range of the scale, you know, in young kids, and often you can see certain behaviors that are triggered, right by those, um, because there's neural circuits have been triggered. So it's those hormones that trigger um adult reproductive behaviors because of those kind of circuits. OK, so behavior does change. You know, circuits in the brain are functioning that didn't function before. Yeah. OK. How are we going? I'm good. So here's a kind of summary really. Um, development can, I mean, adolescence, I think can be summarized by the development of regulatory competence. That's what it is. So regulatory systems are gradually brought under the control of central executive functions. So it's that kind of interface between cognition and emotion. Um There are some kind of problems with that. OK. Number one is that this kind of executive suite, so all these kind of prefrontal cortex type executive functions. Takes time It takes time and it occurs chronologically with age, OK? And yet, particularly as we saw in that very first slide, you know, the Kind of age at which puberty starts is now much earlier, it's 10 as opposed to 14. As opposed to 14 year olds, you know, um, it's just starting puberty, right? Think about the mismatch now between the cognitive changes and the like, hormonal changes. 100 years ago, the hormonal changes were starting. Midway through the cognitive change is already happening. Does that make sense? Because if the cognitive changes are chronological, they're purely based on age, it doesn't matter when your puberty starts, doesn't matter when the hormones come in, they're just going to start happening. Right? So there there there's less of a Disconnect between the cognitive changes and the hormonal changes. What you have now is hormonal changes starting much earlier than the cognitive changes. So you've got Young adolescents Who have the hormonal drives, the arousal, the sensation seeking, the bodily changes, all that kind of stuff. Earlier than the cognitive changes have started. Does that make sense? That's hard, yep. De Uh, Multiple reasons. The primary one is diet. And for a good reason. So the primary one is that just generally across, you know. Most of the world actually, the diet has got. Since the 1920s it's got better, right? from the 1920s in that people aren't starving anymore. Quite basically, right, so people have enough to eat. If people have enough to eat, then their body will develop faster, right? What you're seeing now with the obesity epidemic is that um that's obviously not nutritionally good, so we're seeing again a diet effect more on the BMI. So it's bringing it forward again. So it's probably becoming. Too far forward because BMI is increasing, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so the puberty, the, um, menstruation can't begin without the hormones kicking in. So the, the, the, whether it's BMI or actual fat content, I don't know. I don't know what the actual bi biological process is. I wouldn't like to guess. Um, but whatever process is caused is caused earlier. Yeah, absolutely. So it starts everything off earlier, yeah. Yeah. the change Yeah Not that I know of. What, what is really, really interesting is, um, And that you would, if you think back to your school, right, think back to when you're at school, year 8, year 9. Think about the way in which these things can interact and the impact that has on a kind of child's trajectory, basically, in that some kids may. Um, the cognitive changes may just be a little bit earlier, or even if they don't, right? Um, there's also individual differences, maybe IQ related, but individual differences and when that happens, right? But if you take a child who enters puberty later. Effectively, their cognitive capacity is already there when they start entering, so it might mean that they are much less likely to engage in risky behaviors, much less likely to do those things because the cognitive changes have kind of had a head start compared to the hormones. Flip it the other way around. And if you have a child who starts puberty early, male or female, and they've got all those, you know, drives, arousal, body changes, etc. happening to a very young body that doesn't have the kind of, uh, executive functions to really, you know, maybe not even necessarily ask for advice or guidance, you know, so it's the, the disparity is actually quite impactful. Yeah. OK, um So, just bearing in mind this a little bit, there are some kind of relatively early things like sexual relationships, school assessment stuff that can cause stresses to adolescents, OK, just in modern day life, um. You know, the cognitive capacity might not, you know, it's an age-related thing. Um So that's a kind of tension, if you see what I mean. Um, cognitive development generally occurs later than puberty linked emotional changes now. And as puberty gets earlier and the gap widens, our future generations of adolescents at greater risk of poor outcomes and psychopathology, typical of externalizing problems. So it's really externalizing problems, not only actually externalizing problems, body image, internalizing stuff. Um, it's kind of a risk for all of those, those different things. Think of it like this, OK, the kind of When the hormonal changes occur earlier, when they occur first, you've got a very powerful engine, right, it's a super z souped up car, but you've got an unlicensed driver. The opposite kind of of what of what you want, right? So why is adolescence so hard? Because of layers of change. You've got physical change, cognitive change, emotional change. You've got different rates of change. So you've got the chronologically linked cognitive changes versus the hormone linked uh kind of physical, emotional changes. Um, you've got changes that are different rates from your peers. Right? So you're kind of changing, you're growing apart, um, growing back together again in terms of changes, um, different rates of change from maybe the environment you're in in society that you're in as well. OK, in terms of expectations. And while all this happens, you look like a small adult and sometimes behave like by 112, OK, so often the expectations on adolescents, particularly when they do develop physically early, male and female, are off in that they're expecting someone more mature, they're expecting someone to behave like an adult because they look like an adult. Cognitively, they are not. OK. So that's a little run through adolescence. Do you want to have a Mm Hm, 6 minute break, 7 minute break. 7.5 minute break. OK, I'll see you soon. Thank you.

but at the same time.

SPEAKER 1
Like if you're in a in terms of genuine threat. else I Oh. OK. Yeah. Thank you for the lecture. It was really good. I wanted to ask about the Iowa gamin. OK. OK, so one of which is. So That's the way one day. which suggests it's not. Um. Is it a lot of different ways. adult And we've got one like big. And one big. I. 1 every 10, 11 2.

SPEAKER 0
Um It's always two variable and that someone the way in which you choose you choose completely at random, you might go through the whole experiment and you never experience

and not having to say it.

SPEAKER 1
OK. I I Have you, have a great time. Or whether you to do. Some. Oh. So it's not quite sure which one it is. Yeah. I meant. Something So Yeah Does that mean that they're not stable or does it just mean the tests are. It can come too soon. There's been a big history of this problem. And, um, for something like. Right. It was It's a spider, yeah, um, a spider. I. So. One And behind one of the the bank's gone very, very fast. attention. I. Yeah. Um, just in the next day. So. I. OK. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, don't be my take then I might, um, on the same. I, I'm sorry, I just wanna. I. OK. I. I just. Uh Yeah Uh I I OK. I Yeah I. Yeah I. I I Mm I have a question I have a
