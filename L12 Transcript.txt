question. Um, it's not at all related to this lecture course at all. I'm just genuinely interested from our discussion earlier. Do, and this is a question for all of you, but I guess specifically to the guys in the audience. Do you feel like there's less, um, research or less research interest in. Male friendships during adolescence, or do you, or is it, do you not know enough yet to know, not, not know enough yet. It's what? You think that's not enough? Yeah, there is quite a bit, I think, actually. Yeah, because I think female friendships are recognized to be quite um. Maybe not university-based research, but there's certainly kind of school things that go in. I think just because they recognized to be very It's very turbulent, exactly, so the better you can kind of manage and get girls through those turbulent relationships, the better they kind of do, you know, yeah. Mm Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it, it, yeah. Mm. OK. Uh-huh. Oh, interesting. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I guess in some ways that's that's, that's kind of normal for adolescents because it is that kind of, you know, I've got, I'm showing off to my mates type thing. Um. Any other any other Opinions, comments, yes. Mm. Yeah Right, yeah, yeah, that's true. Yeah. Sensible. Well done, boys. Yes. Mm Hm Oh, OK. I want to know if the guys agree, and they're all sitting there really quietly. Yeah, oh, yes, hello. Sorry, I ignored you.

SPEAKER 1
I think one thing I I think a lot of it is that with like adolescents. Behavioral front your brother Mhm. It's like, oh, you like this cool thing as well. Like So I think it's, I think it's somehow more obvious. Mm. I think it's Very different ways There should be more research time Mm online Mm.

Oh, interesting, thank you. Any, any, yeah. Mhm, mhm. And it's done. Mm, yeah. Just like a band-aid, ripped off, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, so it kind of continues and it kind of escalates and yeah. Yeah, interesting. Yes. I Oh, the TV one, yeah. Yeah, that I did a little. Yeah, I mean, there's obviously, there's, you know, boys and girls are like that, right? They're two normal curves that are quite close to each other. So obviously there's, there's overlap, um. Interesting No, it is interesting because like it's, it's, it's one of those things like even as a, as a developmental researcher, right, I'm always gonna be out of touch with kids. Like in the same way that I can't, I don't have any insight into like being a young guy growing up in Australia. I don't have any insight because I one, I wasn't in Australia. Secondly, um, you know, that that's not what I experienced, right? But the same way as a developmental researcher, I can't do that for kids either. Which I'm about to show you in a minute. Don't try and be cool, cause you never will be. It's like I said to my, I said to my daughter the other day, she's just turned 11. She was trying to tell me something, something, I can't remember what it was. It's being silly. And um I said, oh, I think my students are probably cooler than you, honey, I'm sorry. And she was like. And I said, because they're kind of, you know, twenties, and that's like the coolest age, and she just went. Well I was so convinced he was way cooler than me. Sorry, she's not, she's not, she's, she's 11. OK. This is the last one, this one is gonna seem like it's totally practical. It is still accessible, just so you know. So don't just write it off as completely not accessible just because it's mostly um. Practical stuff. The first part, I get to talk to you about careers. If you have a completely fixed career plan, and you are on that track, you may zone out and ignore me for the next 10 minutes. If it is not fixed in stone, then you might need to listen to me, OK? Learning outcomes, there you go. OK. Adult child interaction, um, relevant for a large array of different careers. All of the ones mentioned there, which I won't talk about, but the pictures hopefully should also demonstrate the range of types of adult child interactions you can talk about. So. What else? When it comes to careers. I think the one thing that you've often, not you personally, but what people often forget to do is ask these questions, right? What are the, what are the important questions? What sort of job do you want? Do you want to be in an office? Do you want to be traveling around? Do you want to be working outside? Um, Money is more of a factor nowadays, I would say, than it ever has been. In terms of how much you need to earn in order to live the life that you want to live, if you like, do you want to live in Sydney or not? Like you'd be much better off if you don't, um, but then you've got to earn enough money if you don't, right? So I know this might sound really patronizing because I know you've probably thought about all this stuff, but it is, if you haven't thought about it, it is worth thinking about, OK? Other considerations in terms of flexibility, do you, are you wanting a family? You want to be able to be a stay at home mom or dad for a bit. What, how flexible is the job that you're looking at? Um, what are your interests and enjoyment? What's your personality like? You know, do you like working in a team and doing team, you know, solutions to stuff, or really not? It's an important, important consideration. OK. Um Here, what skills do you have? We've been really bad, I think, so far. We, we're getting better because we are starting to do it. We've been really bad at letting you know what you can do when you finish 3 years of this degree. You can do all of these, plus more. There's a whole like list that people have generated. Um, so you're much better than the vast majority of people at understanding data, understanding scientific quality, so in other words, not being, uh, tricked by false statements, false science. You can read, assimilate, and communicate difficult, interesting, important knowledge. You can present that knowledge, your basic knowledge base, basic knowledge base, your knowledge base is uh larger than you think. OK, the vast majority out of people out in the street, if you ask them what psychology is, they think you're all sitting in a room on a sofa talking to each other. No kidding. That's what the vast majority of people think psychology is, right? The general literacy of the population regarding psychology is incredibly low. I once had a conversation with a guy, um, after I'd just finished my PhD, right, just finished it and I was on the street for some reason, and I bumped into this guy, um, and for some reason he started on a rant to me about, uh, what he called them a psychopaths. What I discovered he meant was people with schizophrenia. And I was like going. But that then, you know, they're not the same thing. You know, they're very different, you know. Challenges, and he was like, no, no, no, no, I actually, they're all the same because they, and he would not listen to me. I even said to him at one point, I have a PhD in psychopathy. No, it didn't matter, it didn't matter at all. He knew. So, so it's not only is the understanding low, but it's also very entrenched, very entrenched into what psychology is, OK? So don't underestimate what your knowledge base is. You also have skills in terms of working with other people, interpersonal, not just from doing interpersonal stuff, but also just from understanding the way in which different people function, yeah. Outside of your degree, what are your hobbies and your interests, skills, experience, cos they're also really important. So a study was just done. We had them here presenting at a colloquium talking about the jobs that people go into after 3 years undergrad. It's incredibly broad. Um, one of the most interesting things they found was that something about something like, um, It was something ridiculous, like 79% of jobs advertised in wherever it was, were relevant for psychology, and approximately 15% mentioned psychology in the requirements. OK. Don't ignore job descriptions just because they don't say psychology undergrad. In fact, I was talking to people that work in juvenile justice, um, about a year ago, juvenile justice and what's it called, um, docs, effectively, maybe call docs. Um, and they were saying they're always desperate for psychology graduates. I after the 3 years desperate, and I was like, well, why don't they? Advertise for them, because they advertise for social, they say, please have a social work or sociology background. They're desperate for psychologists because you're better, you're more knowledgeable and more qualified, OK? So don't underestimate what skills you have. Uh, my tip is always this, you need to have a game plan. You need to have 3 options in terms of jobs that you want. You need option one is what job you want to do with a really good honors mark. So that's the one where you think you might want to do clinical, you might want to do forensic, that's your kind of, you know, registered psychologist pathway. Great, that's your option number 1. What option are you gonna do if you get honors, but maybe in the, in the middle bottom, uh, half? Second option, OK? There are things, there are multiple things you can do, but you need to have a think about what that is, and what are you gonna do if you don't get into honors or you don't want to do honors. It's all, it's all, that's another thing, you have choice. I do a little speech at the beginning of honors, which some of you will be unfortunate enough to hear next year. Um, I do a little speech which is, if you are here and you don't think you want to be here, you don't need to be here. You don't have to do honors just because you get in. OK? Don't just do it because you get in, do it because you want to do it. Um It's OK not to have a plan. It's genuinely OK. Yes, you've got to consider financial considerations, etc. etc. Um, but if you work out what you need to earn, just apply for a job that gives you what you need to earn. When I finished my undergrad in the UK I had no intentions of going back to university. I had a great time at university, but I had no intentions of going back and I was taking a show to the Edinburgh Festival in August, right, which is fun, do that, you have a chance. Um, so I was doing that and I actually forgot that I needed to have a job. That's the kind of student I was, just, just so you know. Um, and so I applied for whatever was in the paper and there was a job I wanted to stay in the town I was in. I knew I wanted to stay in that city. Um, I applied for a job that happened to be at a school for kids with emotional and behavioral disorders and that's. Beginning of everything else, so I worked for 4 years between undergrad and starting a PhD. Just doing random stuff. So it's OK not to have a plan because sometimes not having a plan will give you a plan. OK. These are the careers that came to the event I did this year, last year. To be fair, most of them are because I know them, they're my friends. Um, but they still came because they want you. So we have consulting, PWC is a big consulting company, ID cares, theft, identity theft. They're quite cool. Genetic counselor, have you heard of that? Genetic counseling is uh being a counselor for people who have genetic, either genetic disorders or susceptibility or risk for genetic disorders. Um, defense came, uh as in army. Speech path by the way, the army will pay you to do the clinical masters. Did you know that? You then have to work for the army. Afterwards for a little bit, but still, they will, they will pay for you. Um. Speech pathology, OT. So these are kind of changing you do a master's, you've kind of slip, flip, flip what you're doing, go straight into the master's. Uh, teachers, lots of people go into graduate education, um, journalist friend was there. Social services, child protection, New South Wales Police, there are specialist roles within the police, things like child protection officers, etc. ARDT ARTD consultants, we already have someone working there from here, um, who got the job from going to the careers event, um, who I know it's good. Um. They do kind of lots of work in consultancy and mental health, particularly with government and stuff. People have gone on to do graduate medicine, so they've re-shifted, rechanged, and you can go into school counseling without doing the clinical master's in psychology, but they are just different routes. OK. That's enough of me being ranty. I promise that's it. Um, if you do have queries about careers and stuff, you are allowed to email me because it's kind of my, actually my job, but it's. I pretend it's my job. OK, so today we're gonna look at adult-child interactions in more of a kind of professional role. So we're gonna look from the forensic perspective, both the child as a victim and the or a witness and the child as a perpetrator. OK? I also look in terms of psychological research. This is relevant. Um, For those of you in 3916, we kind of, we've talked about, you know, kind of testing a child and the ethics of that, so this is kind of relevant to that, um, and in terms of clinical interview or treatment. OK? So here are the things that I think matter across all contexts, 4 things. Number one is consent. Number 2 is the comfort of the child. Number 3 is the reliability of data, and number 4 is do no harm. They're the 4 things that really matter in the kind of adult-child interaction space. So, consent. What do we mean by consent? So it's different depending on what space you're in, so. Uh, if you're in doing research, remember your sonar days where you were being tested by other people. Um. That's, that's consent, right? That's informed consent when you first fill in a form, you read a thing, fill it in. Um, you have to consider things like this, age of the child. If your child is over the age of like 8, 9-ish, you might give them a form to sign, that's giving their consent. Right, they're reading a sign. They say, I understand what it means, and I'm signing to say that I want to take part. If they're younger than that, you need to see some sign of ascent. So scent is not written, it's saying to the kid, do you want to do my research project now? And they go, OK. That's a scent. Yeah, or if it's an even younger child, it's, you know, do you wanna, do you wanna do this jigsaw puzzle now, if that's whatever it is, and they just go. That's that's it. OK. You might even videotape that. Sometimes they do that for for consent. Um. Importantly, and again, think about the age of the child, even the mental age of the child, how do we know if a child wants to stop? Right, a research context, you are a random adult that they do not know, probably. They are a child. How likely is it that if they really don't want to do it, they're going to say, you know what, I want to stop now. Very low. Very low. OK, so you have to make it very, very clear that they can. What kind of signs do you think might indicate that a child wants to stop taking part in research? What might we look out for? Yeah, if they look uncomfortable, if they're kind of, you know, looking very not interested, scribbling around on the chair, that kind of thing, yeah. Yeah, absolutely, they're just, they're not into it, yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. They might vote with their behavior and just be like, hm. Done, yeah. Yes. Yeah, they could do, yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I get that every swimming lesson from my kid in the pool. All the time. Yeah. Yeah, there are many things you might want to look out for, and you just check, are you OK to keep going? Do you want to stop now? Yeah, there's always a tension when you're a researcher because you really, really want the data. You really, really want it, because it's so hard to get from kids. So it's always that tension. You just got to be. Chill. Um, how do you know if a child is informed? The uh the consent. How do you know if it's informed consent? Mhm. Yeah, excellent. You could say, so, you know, I've told you what we're doing now. Do you understand? They go, uh-huh. So you say, so, you know, what are we doing now? Yeah, what are we doing today? If they're really little, you don't. Right, if you're, if they're really little, it's the parents that you've got consent from. OK. Um, and you can't inform them because they don't, they're not capable of understanding. We need to be careful of these things. Again, with that desperation to get data, you need to be careful you don't cross the bridge from explaining to cajoling. So explaining would be going, so this task is going to be done on a computer and it's going to take about 20 minutes, um, and uh after that you'll fill in a form and then you'll blah blah blah. Cajoling is going, so this is a really super fun task on the computer. You get your own mouse, it's amazing. Um, and then it'll take, it's really quick, it won't take you long at all, right, to do the task. That's cajoling, right? You're trying to make it sound much better than it actually is. Incentivizing versus bribing is simply basically the timing of when you do something. Incentivizing is fine. Incentivizing is going, you're doing, you know, thank you for doing so, for concentrating so hard, you're doing great. Uh, I just want to give you a sticker for all the hard work that you're doing, right? Bribing is going if you complete the experiment. I will tell your mum to get you an ice cream, right, or even if you complete the experiment, I will give you a sticker, right? So it's different, it's about the timing of the reward. You have to think about what details might be important to the child. Where will the research take place? Will mum and dad be there? OK, does the child know if mum and dad will be there or not, or whoever their caregiver is? Have they been informed of that? Will they be on camera and recorded? Instinctive to ask the parents, do you mind if you record the session, you have to ask the kid. Some of them hate it. Some kids hate being photographed, hate being recorded. Just it's often it's a stage and it's fine, they just don't like having to smile, um, but if they don't want it, they don't have to do it. Um, really simple ones like can they leave to use the toilet? Otherwise you're gonna get a piddle on the floor. Quite genuinely, it will happen, right, because they haven't been told that they can leave and go to the toilet. Really classic one, have they had a snack recently? This is important, particularly if you're doing cognitive testing. And when I, my uh brother-in-law, brother-in-law. Yes, brother-in-law, um, he's a doctor. He worked in Kenya for quite a while. I lived there for a while before they kind of came out to a similar place and I was visiting him, and he was working in this big, big project looking at, um, neurological impacts, basically of developmental study, neurological stuff. And they are seeing him do the testing, um, going through the cognitive stuff, and he said they were about 2 months in when they realized they had to stop and restart because none of the kids they were getting in had eaten properly or drunk anything. So the cognitive testing was, was inaccurate, right? These are kids that were super hungry. So they brought them all in, they gave them breakfast, and they gave them juice, high sugar, um, and then they did the testing. So it seems silly, but it's very important. You get the same thing at schools, often, um, schools where they have kids who they know are either below the poverty line or have struggle with breakfast when they do HSC when they do exams, and quite correctly, they will give them breakfast beforehand, right? Can't expect the kid to function without food. So what do we mean by consent in the legal context? That's research. What about legally? Legally, it's quite interesting. So witness, and by witness, um, I mean, also potentially a victim as well. One thing kids often don't know is that they have the freedom to speak or not. Right? If they've seen something happen, they don't have to tell anybody. They don't have to say what they've seen. Now there can be huge pressure from a parent or a teacher to say, you know, you, you saw it, you say what happened, right? They need to be informed that they do not need to do that if they don't want to, their freedom to speak or not. It's also important to recognize with these kids of this, um, in this situation, one, whether they do have a good understanding of the truth, and that's a developmental thing. Um, and also the influence of others. So, um, But if you think of any kind of situation which is involving the legal system, it's gonna be some kind of stressful situation, right? It's gonna be bad in some way, and the influence of other people can be quite extreme, even if the kid just saw it and had nothing to do with it. The influence of people saying you need to say this, we need to say that, um, you've got to be aware of that, OK? In terms of a kid who's a suspect, um, and this is a really big problem is that they often don't understand, um, they actually don't understand the seriousness, not serious, they don't understand the implications of the situation that they're in. Right? So often when a kid is charged with something, particularly something serious, um, They don't, they're not old enough to understand that it's in their legal best interest not to say anything, or at least wait, you know, wait for the lawyer to, you know, do all that kind of process, often they're just kids, so they just want to say. Um, either what actually happened, in which case they Demonstrating guilt. The understanding of often they, when you kind of talk to kids, not personally, but when you, kids have been interviewed after the fact where they've admitted to something, they often just say, I just thought I could go home. I thought if I said I did it. Then I could just, I just wanted to go home. Right? Um, so it's really important that they understand what their situation is, OK. And the effect of authority, obviously police officers, um, lawyers, all scary people, to kids. So, kind of the point being here, I think is that the implications of consent and what we mean by it vary according to the context in which you're talking about, the professional context. Yeah. Clinical gets even more interesting, I think, in terms of kind of ethics, um, because if a child is seeing a clinical psychologist or counselor, whatever they might be for treatment, even if it's like an OT or a speech therapist, they're there for treatment, right? So someone's designated them in need of treatment. What if they don't want to? What if they really don't want to? Um, it's a lack of engagement, the refusal of consent or a challenge to be overcome? What do you reckon? Yes, which one? Mhm OK, so you think depending on how old the kid is, they, it's a challenge to be overcome, to get to engage, yeah. So how would they demonstrate their consent then? I know, it's tricky, isn't it? It's tricky. Yeah Mhm Potentially, yeah, that that's certainly true, so if there's significant developmental delay or something like that, they could well be, yeah, um, unable to give consent, yeah, um, what in the case of something like separation anxiety? The treatment effectively for separation anxiety is separation. You know, as harsh as that is, that's basically the treatment. So does that mean you don't treat the child? That's some There's certainly one thing you would, yeah, exactly, you certainly look at doing that, so if it's some kind of exposure therapy, yeah, which even adults find really unpleasant, um. You would want to be doing it in a way that the child was on board with. Yeah, so often psychoeducation of the kid, explaining to them actually, so giving them informed consent, right? Often consent isn't there because they're not informed. Um, so explaining to them this is what we're doing, this is why we're doing it. But in the context of things like antisocial behavior problems, sometimes the kids do not want to take part. They're not in the right space. They have no interest in talking to somebody they don't know. Um Very, very tricky, yeah. It can be, it can be. I mean, one of the interesting things is that we look at the success rates of psychological treatments, they're not amazing. The highest is about 40% for anxiety, right? That's a genuine numbers. So I think it's totally, you should be probably expecting a certain number of clients to come in to go, you know what, you're not, you don't want the treatment, you're not ready for it. It's unfortunate, you know, I'd love you to be, but you're not. I mean, I should always caveat, I'm not a clinician. I am married to one, but I'm not one, right? Um, so I haven't done the training. So when I say stuff, I'm saying it kind of from uh other things I've heard from other clinicians or my kind of opinion of working in the area, right? But just take it with a pinch of salt, not necessarily the advice that you would be given. There might be very clear rules about different diagnoses, different ways in which you get a child to engage that I'm not aware of, OK? So can a child request the parent to be present or absent? Really difficult things of custo custody cases, um, you can get legal situations that are very complicated. Um, what if the child is in the care of social services, who gives consent? The reality of this is that often all three. But there are situations where the, Um, biological mother, biological father, if they're involved in the child, plus the current caregiver, whether that's docs or whatever, all of them have to give consent for treatment, all three. Um, should a child be informed as to the nature of their participation? It's like the question we had earlier, if it's a spider phobia, right, and you're going to expose them to spiders. That's not nice if you've got a spider phobia. OK, so that's consent, it's a little speedy, speedy, yeah. Um, to be honest, I don't know. I don't know if it varies by, um. Age, I mean, obviously a child that's under the age of one. You know, has no, has no option. Um, so I think it's, it's probably on a kind of case by case situation, I would imagine basis. I mean, like we've said before, a child who doesn't, even if they're in treatment. There's nothing to say they have to engage, they can sit there silently if they want to. And I give them quite a lot of credo actually if they managed to sit through an hour of being talked to silently. I think that's quite impressive. Um, but they can, you know, they can vote with their behavior as well. And it may be that then the adults decide actually it's not worth it. Um, but I don't actually know what the kind of, um, guidelines guidelines are. OK, well I comforted the child and I mean, 11 year I showed that and someone went, oh, I had one of those. Which is cool, it's great. Um, I don't mean that. I mean more of a kind of psychological, emotional, um, comfort of the child. So here are kind of 4 factors I think are important in terms of this one. So this is now, regardless of the way in which you think you might work with children in the future, if you do, if you don't, don't worry about it. Um, but useful to know anyway, because you will be in a situation at some point in your life, um, where you have a kind of authoritative role with a child. So comfort of a child. Think about the familiarity of the space that you are in. Um, have you met the kid before? Has the child ever been interviewed before? OK. Again, remember, development, childhood is a lot about first things, new things. So it's highly likely that the kid has never been interviewed by a professional before in their life. OK, so even that is a new, a new thing, OK? It might not be. Other kids, particularly those in the kind of justice system or um social services system are very used to that kind of thing, right? So they, you know, may behave quite differently. What's the environment like? Um, is it welcoming? Is it child friendly? If you've ever been into like a, a Have you anyone been to the kids part of RPA recently? Kids RPA and we've been way more too many times to the kids RPA emergency department. Um, it's very lovely. They have bubbles, you'd be, but it's pretty cute. I mean, it's, it's an emergency department, right? So it's functional, um, but they do make an effort to make, you know, they've got like bubbles and it's kind of. Yeah, they wear a cute, they, they got a little, it's very cute, um, and it's little things like that that actually, you know, show that you're thinking about how comfortable the child is. One of the ones I always have a big issue with because the number of times I discovered this is not happening is, is your environment confidential? Is your office soundproof? Kids are not stupid. If they're standing outside your door and they can hear you talking to another kid, they know that what you say to them will be hurt, right? It's like I remember a long time ago. Remember at my school, we had some kind of school counselor, I think she came like once a fortnight or something, I don't know. But we, she was there, and um it was, it was one of those really, really classic, classic, like, not, no one thought this through, because if you wanted to see her, you had to sit on a bench outside her office. For like half an hour, and it's like. If look, you know, if you were confident doing that, then good on you, but the number of kids that probably wanted to see you and thought there's no way I'm sitting there showing everybody I want to speak to the school counselor. Completely stupid. Um, also they're physically comfortable, right, if you're talking to small kids, they need to be able to fit on the furniture that you are providing. Uh, this is an important one. and we'll see a video in a minute of this done very well. Explanation. So being very clear about what's going to happen, how it's going to happen, what the expectations are. If it's a new place, give them a tour, show them where the toilets are, show them where the sink is, show them where the snacks are. The reason I put honesty and transparency there is there are two different things. Honesty is obviously good. Transparency is better. So honesty would be saying, um, So in this task here, it takes about 20 minutes and after that, you're free to go home. Transparency would be saying you're not changing anything, the truth is still there, but you're saying it takes about 20 minutes. Some kids have taken about 10, but some kids have taken 40. Right, it's giving that kind of extra layer of, I'm putting everything out there for you. Everything is open for you to understand and to see. Um Affect refers to your own affect. Regardless of what, in what kind of circumstance you're interacting with a kid, um, it's quite important that your, your, your face does the right thing. I was, I learned this in a really specific way. So my second job after uni, um, when my first one finished, was working in criminology research, and it was a project looking at longitudinal, uh, crime. So youth crimes, a teenagers, basically, we interviewed loads and loads and loads, like hundreds of teenagers about naughty stuff that they did. It was great. Um, but what we did is we coded what they did 4 days of their life that we coded numerically. But we were asking them stuff. And now these, these teenagers had been talking to the same research group for about 5 years. They were very familiar with us. So we heard some very, very, very illegal things. The only one we had to report was treason. Legally we have to report treason, i.e., trying to kill, kill the Queen, um. No one was, no one was gonna do that, it was all good, uh, but there were some other, you know, exciting things that were happening. Um, if you sit there and they go, yeah, so I went round to my mate's house to get a chain so we can go and beat up the neighbors next door, if you go. They're not gonna say anything else, right? For them, it's clearly fairly normal, right? You have to understand your normal might not be their normal. You have to respect what their normal is, right? So if you're like, oh my gosh, um, they're, they're not gonna say anything else. They also, it's also judging, right? You might, you might make them feel something that they hadn't felt before, because no one's reacted in that way before. Um, it's also important to pay attention. It's a kind of fine line between being like the scary person that's like, you know, Interrogating someone and just actually making sure that you are listening to what they're saying. It's a really good idea to video yourself. If you want to work in this kind of area, take a video of yourself talking to someone else, doesn't have to be a kid, and you'll actually see what your body does, because sometimes it's not, you're not aware what your body does. Um, I've actually spent hours in different jobs doing exactly this. It's the most slightly horrific, right, because you're kind of watching yourself going, um, but it's very interesting. Yeah. Oh yeah, all the time. You hear yourself talking. It, I would say, actually, with that, but it's also important to be Oh, that's next slide, it's coming. It's coming. OK, um. This is specifically now talking about kids at risk. So when I say at risk in this context, I'm typically talking about kids who are at risk or either have a background of abuse and neglect, or who are involved with docs, or who are have kind of criminal uh stuff going on in their family, that kind of at risk, OK? Not just low SES. Um The appropriate language is really important, so, Just think about the age of the child, the mental age of the child. OK, what's the actual mental age of the child? Are you using words that they don't really understand? Um, it is really important to remain that kind of professionalism. So you can be chatty, you can be normal, you can be relaxed, but there's gotta be that line, particularly with kids at risk. They have to be very, very clear, you have to be very, very clear that there is that professional boundary, there is that line, OK? And you just got to be confident to keep that line. Um Say things in your, when I say say things in your own words, everyone has a different background, right? Some of you here will have been to the nicest schools in Sydney. Some of you in here will not. Some of you in here will have had massive will have massive families, some of you will not. OK, so you've all come from very different backgrounds. You don't need to try and be anyone different. In my experience with these kids, particularly these kids, they actually judge less than than the vast majority. OK, they're very not judgmental. OK. My accent is effectively quite posh. It's like posh British, and I went to a state school in Essex. So I have this weird, I can, depending on various factors, I can flip from a kind of Essexy accent into a BBC British accent, which I think maybe now has a slight Australian twang, but maybe not. Um, hopefully, come on, it's been 10 years, um. The point is that there's no point in me trying to change my accent or change anything about me to try and get the kids to like me. It doesn't work because they see straight through it, so just be you. And yes, they might take the piss out of you for some things, and that's totally fine, right? But they will, they'll see through it if you don't. OK? Don't try and be cool because you won't be cool. Even now, even at 20, whatever you are, to a 13 year old, you're like a daggy loser, right? That's the honest truth. I'm really sorry. Oh, think about me, I'm like a grandma. Um, appropriate body language. OK, very important, OK? Again, in terms of attention, you want to be engaged with the kid, right, you're talking to them, it's important, they need to know that you're actually listening. Um, be relaxed, you know, but it takes practice sometimes to be, sometimes you have to fake it till you make it in terms of being relaxed, particularly around at-risk kids. I was once slightly inappropriately put in charge of a class of, um, 15 year olds. This is a school for naughty kids, EBD school, sorry, I shouldn't say that. School for emotional behavioral disordered kids. Um, and there's one boy in there I knew quite well who's the same height as me, um, his arms were the size of my thigh. Um, from build, build, you know, building, bodybuilder, um, and he had a reputation, certainly had a criminal record, um, and I was put in charge of the class and I was holding the pen, the whiteboard pen, right? And he came up, he came up and he tried to take it out of my hands, right? And I was doing the best, like, my face was like, I'm totally relaxed. I'm just chatting here. My hand was like this. I was like, there's no way he's getting the pen off me, but I was trying to be relaxed. And then she said, oh, miss, you're like well strong. I was like, thank you. Um But that takes practice, right? I've been there for like 6 months when that happened, so it does take, you know, time before you feel confident enough to do that. By the way, this is the same boy that once said to me when I was alone with him, Miss, what would you do if I raped you? Same kid. Now I knew him well enough. I knew him well enough to know that he had serious domestic violence in his family, and I actually took the benefit of the doubt and I assumed he was genuinely asking, not me personally, but what would a woman do? Right, and so I went with that interpreter, in fact, I kind of slightly. But this, I, I said I wouldn't let that happen because I have a duty of care towards you, right, so I wouldn't hurt you if that's what you meant. So I tried to kind of, this was not conscious, right? I was like, oh, I tried to flip the, uh, the kind of dynamic slightly, right, and say I wouldn't hurt you, that's what you mean, cos I have a duty of care towards you, um. And then we kind of talked about it, right? But if you don't know a kid, That kind of thing can come across as very, very threatening. Yeah, he didn't mean it in that way at all. He was genuinely just asking what we would do. Yeah. Depending on what happened, I think probably depends on what's happened. Yeah, it, it's difficult, right, because it wasn't, you have to remember this is also a kid who's probably got an IQ of about 85. Um, who's quite developmentally delayed, um, other stuff going on, you know, so you can't expect the language to be perfect, right? So it was, it was, it was, um, You could interpret it in two different ways, right, Miss, what would you do if I raped you? Um, yes, you could see it as a threat, you know, what would you do right now? Or, you know, what should a woman do if they're in that situation, which I think was the one he was going for. Yeah. Either way, as, as soon as I kind of told her I wouldn't hurt him, it became that one. See what I mean? I don't know which one it was, um. These ones, personal interpersonal space, if you're in my tutorials, I'll explain what these are before. Again, drawing that line. Kids at risk, particularly with abuse backgrounds, will often cross this line. Oh, I've got to get across. Um, this is personal space between here and here is your personal space. They shouldn't come inside your personal space, right? Kids at risk, kids with abuse backgrounds often come inside your interpersonal space. This is this elbow here. OK, if they come inside here, um, totally not OK. Not OK. OK, so you, you just say it, you say, look, you know what, this is my interpersonal space. You can't come in there. There's no judgment, you just can't do it. OK, um, in terms of predicting behavior, it's quite often a good idea to recognize when I say trauma triggers, I do in this context mean quite genuine. I don't mean a kind of popularized, um. Meaning of that phrase. I mean, I mean, kids that are going to go into some kind of meltdown. Um, think about stimuli that may be relevant given their backgrounds, um, and also read their body language. Read what they're doing, OK? And also, I should also say in that context, also ask for help. If it's the first time you've worked in this kind of context, this kind of job, go to people more senior and say, I don't know what to do in this situation. You know, that's, you're not meant to know, you're not meant to kind of instinctively know. Um. If this is a setup, it's a school, for example, you've got one kid who's in trouble. They're at risk. They've got a background of um Maltreatment, etc. um, and you want to chat to them, where would you put them? Which chair would you put them on? You've got the choice of chair number one. Chair #2 or chair #3. We both share number one. You 2. Reverse number 3 OK, we've got a mix. Um, I would put them on chair number 2. I'll tell you why. Chair number 1, you're blocking their access to the, you're blocking their exit. OK, that could be quite a threatening situation for a kid. They might not want to talk in that situation. Uh, chair number 3, you cannot stop them from going down the exit, right? So they'll do a run up, potentially. So here, if you put them here, you, you, they've got access, right, they can leave, but you've also got some space. Yup. I, I have watched it, yeah, I have watched it, yeah. Well it's tricky because I've seen so much worse. Um, so I think I'm biased in that kind of respect. So so I didn't find any of it kind of shocking or anything like that. Um, look, I think it's a good, um, it's good to get talking about all this kind of stuff. And it's good to recognize that, um, kids, particularly, I think boys, maybe particularly in the UK, um. That, um Not poorly represented, I think they're poorly, you know, they're in a difficult situation, I think at the moment, um, particularly young adolescent boys, yeah. OK, we're gonna watch this, are we gonna watch this? No, cause we've got like 10 minutes. You may, oh no, you can't watch this. Um, I'm gonna skip it because it's not actually that interesting. It's, um, it's a good demonstration. Sorry, I speak on it. So I've got a more interesting video coming up. Um, it's about building rapport with a, with a child client in a legal context. OK? And basically what it says is that you have to, in order to build rapport, you have to take your time. You have to keep your promises if you make it, so don't make any promises that you cannot keep. You're working with kids that may well have had very difficult interactions with adults, so it's gonna take time. OK. Go slow is the kind of general. Comment, oh, in that, and in that context, um, it's your canvas quiz, we have to be super quiz quick because we have to get to the end of this uh lecture. I may run over by 10 minutes, um. Have you got, got your canvas thingy out? No, go, go, go, go, um. OK. Which of the following would be recommended as means to improve the comfort of a child in an initial meeting? OK, um, A, suggest the child sits closer to you on the sofa to be comfy. Oh sorry, blind vote, blind vote. A, suggest a child sits closer to you on the sofa to be comfy. B. Explain to the child what your job is and why you are speaking to them. Save the child time by getting straight to the critical questions. Assume that the fact that the child isn't leaving means that they are giving consent. Tell the child that everything the child says will be a secret and that you won't tell anyone what they said. Well done, everybody. Open. That's very good. It is B. OK, explain to the child what your job is and why you are speaking to them. Um, this one's very, you can't tell, um, there are certain situations where you can't do that. So if a child tells you something, for example, I plan to kill the Queen in our scenario, um, I cannot keep that secret. I have a legal obligation to inform said Queen, um, that she is under threat. Oh. She's already know, it was Queen then, um, OK, reliability of data, here we go. Across all contexts you want quantity of information. So you want them to complete the tasks or the interviews. If it's a legal situation, you want sufficient evidence, right? You want to be able to build a case. You need to consider whether you do a single interaction versus repeated interactions. Frustrating, you might only want to do one, you might be better to do two or three. A classic one here is cognitive testing. If you're testing a kid cognitively, um, you may not be able to do it in one. The kid's gonna be too tired, they're gonna be performing sub, subpar. How do you maximize data quantity? Number one is you build rapport, OK, so you get them comfortable talking to you. Take lots of breaks to take that pressure away. Um, and please inform them of the likely duration honestly. OK, so it's open and um. If you discuss the options for completion, you're more likely to get completion than if you don't discuss the options for completion, again, depending on the age of the child. Um, in terms of extracting information, you want quality, so truthfulness of the information. You need to make sure that they understand the truth, that they're not being influenced by authorities, they're not, they're not saying what they think you want them to say, that works both experimentally, clinically, legally, every single situation, um. And that they're not just trying to please you, basically. OK. In terms of forensics, um, and I'm going to spend a little very fast, small amount of time looking at this, um, in terms of witness or victim testimony and disclosure. Disclosure is when a child comes to you and tells you about a crime. Often the disclosure is talked about in the context of child sexual abuse, so they'll come to you and tell you what has happened. That's called a disclosure. OK. So the question became, how do you interview a child in a way that minimizes the effects of authority or wanting to please, and how do you determine what the truth is? So this was a problem that um was investigated by Professor, Professor Lamb, sorry, at Cambridge, um, who developed these best practice guidelines for interviewing children in cases of child sex abuse. They're called the NICHD Investigative Interview Protocol, um, and they were developed with a huge, we do slides later on, but they were developed with a huge team of people, right? So developmentalists, linguistics, all those kind of police officers to get the best kind of interview you could possibly get. And basically, what they've shown is that the best information comes from free recall. The more you can get a child to talk, the more free recall you can use, the better your information becomes because it's more reliable. It's coming straight from the child without promise. The this protocol requires fewer kind of focused questions, fewer prompting questions, and doesn't advocate for things like anatomical dolls or things like that. Um So that gives you a bit more information. It's recommended reading, you don't have to, um, you do need to read those slides that I haven't gone through, that I've gone through too quickly. OK? Um, but what I want to show you now is what this looks like in real life. Before you finish, you have to see what it looks like in real life. So it has 3 phases, OK, introductory phase, rapport building phase, and substantive phase of the interview. Substantive phase is where you basically get the child first as much free recall as possible to tell you what happened in terms of the event. Rapport building phase is exactly that, building a relationship with a child. The introductory phase seems like it's nothing. See what this introductory phase actually looks like. So this is a kid, um, bear in mind it's quite late at night, uh, he is going to be talking about alleged sexual abuse. The case is actually terribly, it's still on YouTube, um, but it all came out to be not true. The kid, there was nasty stuff going on, but not what he was saying, OK, so just so you have that background.

SPEAKER 2
Hi, before we start, I'd just like to tell you everyone who's here. And tell you where we are. Is that alright? My name's Steve and I'm a policeman and I work here at this police station. The other lady's sitting there. Her name's Cleo.

SPEAKER 0
So when you listen to this, I really want you to think about how many things he is telling him, how many instructions there actually are, OK?

SPEAKER 2
And she's a police lady, and she works at this police station. um. We've both got different jobs today. Cleo's job is what we call the controller. Yeah. And the reason I know what controller is. Go on. Tell me, what's the controller?

SPEAKER 3
it's a police controller that controls everything.

SPEAKER 2
Well, in for this, her job is to control everything that's going on there, so to make sure that she can see what we're doing. And also make sure all that machinery is working OK. So that's why we call her the controller cos she's controlling the equipment. Yeah. And my job is to speak to you really and ask you some questions and also listen to what you've got to say. OK, and near the end. Um, Cleo and I might pop outside and just sort of see if there's anything I've missed or anything else I need to ask you. Would that be alright? Yeah? Yeah, I know, yeah, it's fine, don't worry.

SPEAKER 0
So is he, he's saying everything. I might pop outside with her, we might talk about stuff and come back in. Every single step that might happen, he's explaining. I'm gonna skip towards the end cos you'll see him shift into the kind of rapport building phase.

SPEAKER 2
OK. Um, we're obviously here to talk. I haven't asked you your name, have I, and what your date of birth is. Can you tell us?

SPEAKER 3
Gabriel. Um, my shirt, you mean my son?

SPEAKER 0
You can watch it on YouTube, but even so, I don't think it's fair enough.

SPEAKER 2
Gariva Diarman, so it's it's a hyphenated name, is it? Yeah. And do you have any middle names, Gabriel? Yes, Ewan. Yes. OK, and how old are you? I'm 8 years old. Yeah, 8. And what school do you go to? Christchurch. Church Primary School.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, it's in in Hampstead.

SPEAKER 2
OK, so, and tell me about Christchurch. Yeah. Is that. What year are you in now?

SPEAKER 3
Year 4, but I'm changing into year 5. No, I, I was in year 3, but I'm changing in year to year 5. I was supposed to.

SPEAKER 0
OK, so, um, hopefully you just noticed is that there's nothing, there's no depth into that interview. It's just giving him instructions about what he has to do. There's also one bit where he says, if you need to say bad words, if you need to swear, because I want you to tell me exactly what things happened, and if it's easier for you to do that exactly how it happened, you do it how it happened. So the length they go to, to make it absolutely clear what the expectations are is really important. OK, um, in terms, in terms of do no harm, it's the last line, don't worry. Um, think about what, uh. What is interaction, well, in terms of inappropriate interaction, what does that mean? Things like don't talk about the child when they're in earshot. I don't care how old they are. Two year olds are much more savvy than you think. Um. Don't pretend to know things that you do not. I think kids can see through when you're bluffing. um, so if you don't know, you don't know, that's fine. I definitely don't keep secrets and of course don't cause any kind of fear or concern. When it comes to data, don't presume a debriefing is not required. If you have an ethical, you have an ethical uh obligation to give a debriefing, this is what we did, this is why we did it, this is what we're looking at. Um, don't guess the child's answer, it's really frustrating. When they're like 4 or 5, and they're saying 7000 words, and you know they're trying to get one word, and you know what that word is, and you're like, Do you mean cat? Um, you can't do it. Um, do not provide the answers, OK, and look for confirmation. In terms of if you want to have a future working with kids, and there are some things you can do. So you can get working with children check, you can do that whenever you want. Um, you can get criminal records checked, you will need both in any job working with kids. Um, it has become more annoying at the moment. Um, child protection training is also a thing. I don't, I don't know where you can get it, but you certainly can do it. Um. Also, if you are working with kids, it's worth being a bit of a positive role model, OK? There's no issue with you smoking, but maybe don't let the kids see, cos to, to them, you might be an absolute hero. Right? And they will want to do whatever you do. And you might not know that you might not realize they look up to you that much. OK? Um, and you don't want them to be spending 50 bucks on cigarettes for the rest of their life. Um. So little things like that, OK, and manage your own emotions and your own behavior as much as you can. And practice. Babysitting counts. Babysitting counts, um. Even roleplay counts, um, volunteering, kids after school care, all that kind of stuff counts as well. OK. Yay, that's it, I just about made it. Thank you everybody, thank you, ooh. That's it for me, you've got Mica next week, so er don't forget you've got er Micah, so you're changing tack slightly, you're looking at the cognitive side, the cognitive development.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. Oh, pretty good. How are you? Yeah I just want you want to say thank you so much, you've been amazing. years. But Oh What
