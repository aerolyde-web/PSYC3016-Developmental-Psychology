SPEAKER 1
OK, I'm sorry to um give you a very short break. But um I think my memory is correct on this one. Look, these, these kind of two lectures are quite intense because they're going through a lot, um. Don't worry, just take your time when you're going through them in your own time, OK? There is a lot of, I understand there's a lot of stuff, or the content in this lecture in the next one. Wait for you to get ready. OK. So we are continuing our little journey through the in quote unquote uh hierarchy of social cognition, OK? This would remind you again, um, and we've got up to here. So we've seen that in terms of mirror self recognition, in terms of different forms of empathy, and even in terms of goals and intentions as shown with the mummy ball, baby ball, and the foot button experiment, that actually, uh, chimpanzees and, uh, human infants can do pretty much the same stuff. OK, as far as we can demonstrate evidence for both, um, that's what we have so far. So we're gonna move on now to look at perception and knowledge. And included in that is also so perception and knowledge regarding um other people's uh knowledge, OK? So the perception of other people's knowledge and awareness and the communication of that. So we're gonna jump around a little bit to get us there, so bear with me. Um, so you might remember from, I think, 1st year actually, not even 2nd year, 1st year, um, that. Infants under the age of around 6 months, um, can do some pretty cool things in terms of social stuff. So they're highly sociable. Um, they're smiling, there is giggling, there is, you know, looking, interacting. Do you remember the dance of communication from 2nd year? Yeah. Remember that? It's very important, um, in the kind of development of, uh, very young children. The reciprocal kind of back and forth between a, um, baby and its caregiver. Yeah, that's the beginnings of social communication, right? It goes there, they go, woo, um, back and forth. It's like a little dance folk song. OK, so despite this kind of high degree of sociality, as it says here. In none of those kind of interactions before the age of around 6 months do infants demonstrate um their own interests and attention to outside entities. In other words, um. Not until the kind of second half of the 1st year of life, do they demonstrate a kind of incorporation of outside objects into social interactions with others. So what does that mean? It means that we know that they're very social in terms of smiley and face to face interaction. And like with the dance of communication, there is a back and forth, right? So there's a, it's a good stimulus for them, like an interesting face, a nice sound, um, that's a stimulus they respond to and back and forth. This doesn't mean that they realise that the other person has any thoughts, feelings, or goals that may be different from their own. OK. Now think about that for a minute. You have a really lovely, you know, interaction relationship with a little, little baby, little infant, um. In none of that, are they really aware that you're a being. You know, you're a stimulus, um, and you're a great stimulus. And in many ways you are more than that because, you know, they have this kind of a connection and emotional stuff, but, um, in terms of understanding thoughts, feelings, emotions, they don't. As far as we know. So this kind of lack of referential communication, which comes under things like shared attention, um, following of gays, referential language, etc. suggests that children under the age of 6 months old do not appreciate that the other person has their own mind. OK. That's a point to consider in your own time. OK. I'll show you that in a sec. So here are different forms of um triadic interactions. So triadic interaction means infant. Caregiver. thing. Think could be another person, that's fine, but it's the 3rd thing. it's really saying is up till the age of 6 months old, it's just caregiver, baby. Right, back and forth. And the baby might look at something else, absolutely, but they're not doing that in a way to bring the parent or caregiver involved. OK, they just find something else interesting. So joint attention is when um. Both the baby and the caregiver are sharing an experience of the same thing. It's very hard to measure this, really, because it looks, it can look like a dyadic interaction, right? So if you imagine a parent and a baby are having a shared interaction, right, triadic interaction with a book. They're jointly engaged with the book. They're both enjoying that book, right? That can be a triadic interaction, particularly if you see back and forth, a bit like the dog actually, back and forth between the, um, infant and the, um, parent and the book, right? Or it can just be parents looking at the book and they're going like, Oh, look at the book, it's athletic. And the baby's just going, that's an interesting picture. That's an interesting face. That's an interesting picture. That's an interesting face, right, so it's quite difficult to measure if it is a triadic interaction. However, other things aren't difficult to measure. So following attention. In terms of following someone's gaze or following someone pointing behaviour, that is demonstrating a triadic interaction. Right? So if my baby's here and I look over here and I go, oh my gosh, look at that. And they, they, you know, they're looking at it, that's a triadic interaction, they're sharing my engagement in whatever it is. Similarly, a skill of imitation. OK, so the kind of copying of a behaviour demonstrates the same thing. They want the kind of same cognitive field, right, they understand. That they're sharing some kind of um. Game, task, etc. whatever it is, they're in the same, same place. Also things that are more declarative, right? So, um, it can be gestures, it can also be language. Um, so declarative means kind of like, oh, you know, there's a, there's a monkey. Um, imperative is kind of like, look, the demand. So this, this is actually my kid. This is my oldest. See, I've got all my, all my 3 kids have now been in the lecture. So this is my oldest when she was a teeny tiny baby, um, and she's gonna show you quite a few of these things. She's gonna show you gaze following, point following, and she's gonna show you a declarative, uh, gesture as well. Where's the bird?

SPEAKER 0
Where's the bird? It's true. I I had a tree, Barber.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, 3, I know.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah. If That's the bird. Oh look, there's one there.

SPEAKER 1
OK, so you see the, when I say, Where's the, can you see the bird? Where's the bird? She looks to find the bird. OK. So there's the following kind of instruction, looking for the bird. And then the main one is that point, right? That's, that's a declarative thing communicating to me, saying, there's, there's the bird. OK, so these kind of triadic interactions, um. As I've said before, we need to be very careful when we're looking at shared attention, whether that is incidental or um actually genuinely sharing attention and the triadic interaction. Um, following attention. By gaze or following behaviour, via imitation, you know, you see little kids copying their parents. That's a demonstration of a triadic interaction, right? Because they're understanding the intention of the parent and they're basically just trying to join in. Um, and then we have directing attention as well. So all of these are evidence of, um, triadic interactions. When do they come on board? Basically, between 9 to 15 months old. So, by the age of around, um, oops, by the age of around 13 months old, as you can see here. So these are the cumulative number of infants who passed, kind of tests, if you like, or demonstrations of these forms of triadic engagement. This one at the top here, joint engagement. All of them are passing because that's the one you can't really tell whether it's joint engagement or Incidental. OK, so ignore that one slightly. You can also ignore referential language. Obviously, most kids don't start speaking till around the age of, you know, 11, they should have one word by 1. Easy rule, 22 words by 2, So you're looking at these ones, OK, communicative gestures, so directing attention, attention following, and imitative, um, learning as well, so copying effectively. So by kind of 1213 months, the vast majority of infants are passing those tests. Which suggests that by kind of a year old, just over, um. Infants have some sort of understanding that the other person has a kind of mental. Existence, in other words, right? They are communicating with them, they understand that they have the capacity for thought. Now they don't understand this explicitly, obviously, right? They don't have the language to understand that explicitly, but they're demonstrating this sort of understanding. Which leads us to this, which you should remember from first year, um, social referencing. Right? Social referencing is effectively when an infant learns. From the, typically the expression expressed by a caregiver. Typically in experiments, it's a mother, it can be either any caregiver. As long as there's that, there's that bond there, the bond is quite important. So when infants are around a year old and they encounter a novel object, they sometimes, not always, will look towards a parent, and they will sometimes respond to the object in accord with the effect displayed by the parent. So, for example, you're in the park, one year old picks up a big lump of mud, dried mud, puts it in your mouth. Parent might go, Hmm. Right, gross, um, to which the baby may respond by putting it down. Now I say maybe because they, you know, this isn't like foolproof. They don't always learn like this, they also might quite enjoy eating the mud and continue to eat the mud. Right. The important point is, is that they can do this. OK, they are able by around this age, um. To effectively understand that knowledge can be transmitted via a kind of nonverbal communication. So the one you should be familiar with is this one. So I'll show you the clip. You might have seen this clip before, so I do apologise if you have, but it's quite good to remind yourself of what it is. This is the visual clip. Do you remember this? With the toy and the pretend cliff? You might remember it.

SPEAKER 5
Emotion is a nonverbal language. Did you tell me? Emotions reveal the cognition, the understanding of the baby. And furthermore, emotions are the nonverbal communication. Of the baby towards the parent and the parent towards the baby. Therefore, I thought that emotions were a royal road, one royal road to the study of the baby's development.

SPEAKER 6
In this study, babies between 9 and 12 months are brought into the lab and placed on a large plexiglass top table. Half of the table has a checkerboard pattern just underneath the surface, but halfway across is a visual cliff which the baby can tell drops off steeply. The plexiglas top continues, so it's perfectly fine to proceed, but the baby isn't so sure. And this is a big drop for a baby just starting to crawl. She wants to get across to get the toy. But she's cautious and looks to the opposite end of the table where her mother is. The parent is instructed to smile or make a fear face.

SPEAKER 5
If the mother is posing a fear face, the baby typically does not cross this stair step downward, this modified visual cliff or visual step. On the other hand, if the mother poses a smile or somehow poses a nonverbal communication that is not prohibitive but encouraging, the child is much more likely to cross over to her. This particular study demonstrates the role of nonverbal communication in determining the child's behaviour in uncertain context. A baby will, when they encounter something ambiguous, something uncertain, will typically look to the significant other, the mother, the father, uh, a grandparent, uh, the caregiver. In order to figure out what to do. Come. So by 11 to 12 months of age, the baby is already doing what all of us do when something unusual happens we look around to figure out how other people are reacting.

SPEAKER 1
So stop and think for a minute about how important that is, right? As an infant, everything is new. Like everything is new for a very long time, really, because you haven't experienced stuff. Like the first time you go to the park and see ducks, that's a new thing. Right? So they, they have to use this kind of learning really quite a lot. Yeah. Um, And I mean that should make you think about, you know, the role of parenting. You know, if you have an a parent who is responding for whatever reason abnormally or responding in a way that's unusual. The child is directly learning from that. OK? It doesn't need to be psychopathology, it can also be just, you know, they might have a different idea of what's, you know, OK, what's safe, what's not safe. Um, that's how they're learning is from that kind of emotional expression. OK? So here are the results if you haven't, I think you've seen them before, but just in case you haven't, um, it's really quite clear from this kind of experiment, um, the number you need to look at here is the percentage of infants crossing the deep side, um, so going across to get the toy, when joy or happiness is expressed, 74% are passing, when fear is expressed, none of them, none of them are going across. That's a really the question, like phobia, you mean? Yeah, it's a really interesting question because there's some kind of, some evidence around to say that yes, they can, and there's other evidence to say that, no, they don't really work like that. So it's really, really, um, it's really interesting, actually. Yeah, it's really interesting. I had my, um, my sister and her family used to live in Kenya, and there are big caves there full of bats. And, um, I remember going to visit my oldest niece is quite, quite anxious, naturally quite an anxious little kid. And, um, My sister was there, my sister was I didn't realise this, she is terrified of bats, right, like really phobia level of bats. And so we, she was like, let's go and see the cave. So we walk into the cave. She said to me before we went and she was like, 00, Carol, I've just got to prepare cos I've got to do like my best acting, and she was standing there going. Aren't they amazing? I'll just stand near the door, aren't they amazing cos she was trying not to do that. She was trying not to kind of put across that she was scared that there was a scary, a scary thing, right? Whether it worked or not, I did it. Um. Study 2, here we go. So it's not just about the exact, the precise emotion. Here we just have a generally positive one and a generally negative one. Anger is not the appropriate emotion, right? It's not, it's not a situation to be angry, and it's a situation to be fearful of, but they're demonstrating the kind of crosstalk between generally positive and generally negative emotions. So, again, interest, they will cross over anger, they will not. OK? Sadness, less conclusive, but generally, again, it's a negative emotion. They're picking up on something that's not right. Yeah. OK, so what are the implications? The implications are the infants can appreciate that parents can supply information. It's actually really big, right? Infants appreciate that their parents can supply information, in this example, in the form of emotional appraisal, about novel objects, and objects can be events, people, spaces, etc. Um They then can use that information. To kind of guide their own behaviour, in other words, so in a situation where they're not sure what to do, and again, it depends on personality, right? Personality is there, you might have an infant who's like doesn't care. Right? It's just like, oh, a toy. And he goes for it. Right? There'll be some variants due to that kind of personality trait. And there'll be some that just find the whole situation terrifying, being in a weird room with weird experimenters on a weird cliff thing and just don't want to move. Right? So there's always going to be variants caused by other things in experiments. But generally, um, infants will look to the parent to resolve that kind of uncertainty about what to do. So what are the prerequisites for this? In order to be able to do this, infants need to be able to do some other things beforehand. Number one, they need to be able to decode the signal. They don't, they're not gonna label, right? It's not that they're sitting there going labelling, that's a fear face. That's a sad face, but they need to understand what is communicated in different kind of facial expressions. Yeah. So they need to have experience of those facial expressions. They need to understand what they mean, how they, you know, generally what they, what has there been experienced before when they've seen those expressions. Yeah? They also must understand the referential quality of the information. Basically they've got to understand that the face of the mother or parent, whoever it is, is expressing refers to the situation they find themselves in. That's critical. Right, it could be that a bear's just walked in the room and the parent is showing a fair face at the bear. Right, so we need to understand that that is referring to the bear and not to the situation they are in. Yeah, otherwise they can't learn, they don't learn correctly. They've got to understand that referential quality. Now part of that will be um related to kind of the eye contact and the kind of, you know, orientation of the, of the parent, right? So they've got to be, you know, seemingly looking in the right direction. They also must appreciate the potential for social communication of information. Again, not explicitly, we're not expecting them to have the language for this, but they must at some level, be able to understand that information can be passed from one person to another, which suggests that they understand that other people, particularly caregivers, are sources of information. They have a mind, they have thoughts, they have understanding. It's very hard to kind of think of these things without using those explicit that explicit language. Right, because we are, we're so reliant on language, but somewhere in their capacity is that, right, without the, without the words. This is electric, you don't have to go to the canvas cos there's not another one. I just had it there already, so I left it in. OK? Which of the following is an example of a triadic interaction? A, a toddler splashing in puddles with his brother, B, a toddler sharing food with a dog. C, a toddler clapping along to the wiggles. D, a toddler screaming when he sees a spider. E, a toddler pointing at the moon when on an evening walk with his dad. I shout, who votes A? I'm sorry, I start everybody, otherwise it's not a blind vote. Is A a triadic interaction, a toddler splashing in puddles with his brother? What about B, a toddler sharing food with the dog? What about see a toddler clapping along to the Wiggles? What about Dee, a toddler screaming when he sees a spider. What about a toddler pointing at the moon when on an evening walk with his dad. Yeah, hold on. It is that one, OK, because there are 3 things. Yeah, quite simply, there's a, there's a toddler, there's a dad, and there's a moon, right? And the pointing demonstrates that, um, direction of attention. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely, yeah. Yeah. I think typically they use caregivers because they, you're more likely to see it there, right, because there's things like shyness or weariness and that kind of things that are quite strong at that age aren't there with the caregiver. But experimentally, you're gonna see it with people they're familiar with. Um, I caught you out because we don't know that there's any reference to the brother. OK. They're both doing the same activity, a bit like in, like, you know, little nursery schools, you'll see parallel play. You'll see kids playing next to each other. It's called parallel play. They're not interacting with each other, right? They're doing their own thing. They just happen to be doing the same thing, right? And it's kind of the beginning of, kind of, uh, friendship and those kind of, these kind of interactions as they start by doing the same things next to each other, or doing different things next to each other, and then slowly they learn how to kind of incorporate, which is part of this kind of triadic interaction thing. Yeah, if it's said very explicitly that they did something together with the puddles, right, like doing a dance in the puddles even, that would be different because there it's a combined activity. So you might say that we tried it. Yes. Mm mm. Yeah, yeah. Um, so, experimentally, it's, it's done on faces, um, but. I mean, feel free to actually double check, but I'd be 99% sure that body language would be exactly the same. Yeah. Whatever they've, whatever they've kind of had the experience of seeing and learning, and again, parents will do things differently as well. So, um, you know, the way different cultures also do things differently. The way in which they, uh, demonstrate different things is very different, right? I used to work in, uh, London, not quite a long time ago. And, um, a lot of our research was with, um, Many Nigerian actually, families, right? And so the kind of task was lovely. It was kind of like this um. Kind of a task, um, involve kind of looking at the parent to infant and looking and like, uh, smiling and saying I love you and that kind of thing. And in some cultures, eye contact is considered quite rude, right? So particularly that I used to live in those places, but it was, um, it was very interesting because things like saying I love you. In that context, in some cultures, it's, it's fairly normative. In others, is, is really not, you know, take, you know, Britain, only 50 years ago, not normal. Right? So it's quite an interesting cultural shift to go, how do we measure this in different norms, you know. It's the same with emotional interaction, I guess. Yeah. Yeah Um Oh, that's actually a really interesting question, because all the kind of stuff on, like, um, interactive, um, learning and that kind of thing, you know, has tried to kind of say that. Um, most of the evidence so far suggests that the kind of learning stuff like that isn't as good when it's on a film, and it's on a camera. There's something, there's something to do with the actual physical presence of another person that changes this form of the interaction. So my instinct would be to say, Not necessarily no, but you couldn't really tell. Right, because you don't have that interaction, so you don't have. I don't know what they're called now, yellow wiggle, whatever you, you don't have that wiggle specifically interacting with that child and getting it back and forth. Right, it would just be if they happened to do what the wiggle said. You know, was that triadic or not, not sure. Yeah. The toddler can point at the moon. If the toddler points at the moon, then that's triadic and it's initiated by the toddler, right? If it's the dad pointing, then it's then gaze following or points following as opposed to referential um gestures, yeah. I'm gonna keep going, but you save your questions for the end if you want. OK. So the question becomes, how do you tell the difference then between shared attention or communication of information? So one way of doing this is to ask the question, does an infant update you? If you cha if a change occurs in your absence, right, so do they kind of update your knowledge state? because they effectively realised that you didn't see it. So the 12 month old infants use social gestures, for example, pointing to one, inform other people of new or changed information. And 2, to share mental attitudes, in other words, to communicate with the attention of communicating. Right, that's a hard one to measure, but the way they manipulate that is to do with kind of the likelihood of wanting to communicate. I'll show you in a second. So if they do things, particularly if they do inform other people of new or changed information, it's extremely likely that infants know what other people are likely to know on the basis of what they can see. In terms of perception and knowledge, let's go through that again. If they update other people on events that have changed in their absence, it is very likely that the infant understands that the other person, yeah. They understand what the other person knows on the basis of what they know they've seen. Right. It'll make sense in a second. So here's the, uh, here's the experiment again, simple but nice. So there are um. Uh, two conditions, kind of, and two ways of measuring, right? So this is the experimenter. All that happens is the infant is here in our, our position. And A puppet can can pop out from either this side or this side. OK? That's, that's all that happens. So it either pops out there, it pops out there. There are two conditions. In one condition, um, the experimenter looks and attends the event. It's called attending the event, right? She sees the puppet, in other words. In the other condition, she looks the wrong way. So she doesn't see the puppet, she tends the screen. OK, and what they're interested to see is the number of times, or the mean number of times the infant points at the. Puppet or where the puppet was per condition. OK. They also did the same thing when the experimenter looking straight ahead, and I'll explain why in a minute, when there's nothing there, OK? And they look to see whether the infant updates or points more when they know they didn't see it in the first place. OK. So, first things first, ignore the neutral positive for a second. Um, so the mean number of points per condition is significantly higher, right, there are points from the infant when the experimenter looks at the screen and not the event. OK, in other words, it's a bit like being at the, uh, what's it called, the pantomime. When, when the, uh, experimenter didn't see, when the infant knows the experimenter didn't see the event, they point more, right, as if to say, it was there and you missed it. If they saw it, this one, they attend the event they pointless. The difference between those two suggests that they have an understanding of the knowledge state of the experimenter based on what she's seen. I don't need to update her. She's seen it. OK. You get the same effect here. Um, so this is when she turns back and it's gone, right? So they're not just responding to the puppet being on the screen somewhere, it's now gone. They still point more at an empty screen, they still point more when the experimenter's looking at them and they know that they didn't see the puppet. OK? So when they did this one and then they look straight ahead. But also, the infants experienced um either neutral or positive condition, they didn't mix them up, so it's different groups of kids, but these bars here are for neutral, so that means that when she turned around, she had a neutral face. OK, not nasty, but just neutral. As opposed to a positive face. OK. Now what you see straight away is that the amount of pointing is significantly higher when she demonstrates a positive face. And when she's smiling. Giving a positive emotion, the infant is pointing more. So the authors conclude that these two findings correspond to one, informing, right? So the infant points more when they know they didn't see the puppet, but also sharing. OK, they're more likely to point, more likely to share that information. When it's in a kind of positive communication state to do so. Similar to the yawning actually. The yawning happens when it's, uh, you know, the right conditions, not when there's any kind of threat. You tend to see more communication. When the conditions are correct. Oh, OK. Gotta go fast. OK. Here's another way of looking at it, basic experiment here. If you imagine you're in a room with an infant and you're interactively, positively with one of the toys. So you have these 4 toys and you choose one of them, say that big wire thing, right? You play, have a good time. Then someone else comes in and they put the toy. In the cupboard. OK? Critically, the adult doesn't see. OK, so another adult comes in, hides the toy, the adult hasn't seen where it's gone, maybe they went out to the toilet, but the baby has seen where it is. OK, so your 12 month old doesn't know where the toy is. Adult comes back in, question you then you then ask is what does the baby do? What would you hope the baby would do? Point to the cupboard, right? You hope they point to the cupboard, and you do find that 12 to 14 month old infants will point to the cupboard. But what's critical here, if you, if you've skipped ahead, uh, don't answer. What's critical, critical, critical here in order to infer that the infant is updating your knowledge states. Yeah. Yeah, exactly, they have to assume that the adult doesn't know, so they need to have seen the fact that the adult doesn't know. So what can you do experimentally to make sure? That this isn't just a baby going, that toy I really like is, is there, right? Or just going, I really like that. That's different from communicating, yeah. That is one control, yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely. Um, the other way you can do it is, uh, look at the pointing behaviour in that situation. Yeah, exactly. So if the adult sees the move, they shouldn't be pointing. If they're still pointing, then they're not communicating information. They're just saying, I like rattle. And that's what you do see, by the way. OK, so they reduce pointing if the adult is in the room. So the question becomes, can apes update you? So here we get into a little bit of a tricky situation because they don't really point. They kind of gesture, but they don't do the same kind of, uh, pointing that we do. They don't also really do eye tracking, so they don't follow another person's eye gaze, uh, particularly well, as far as we know, but they can seem to follow gaze by movements of the head. Right? So they'll follow a head direction, but not the eye direction. So how do we establish whether apes understand others' perceptions and knowledge states? In the same way that we can do that with infants. The way we do this is with food competition, um, paradigms. So we know that in the kind of uh naturalistic situation. When there's competition for food, chimpanzees can actually take into account what others can and cannot see, and what they can and cannot hear. OK, so just from naturalistic observation, not in experimental um conditions, people have observed that kind of behaviour. OK? There also seems to be some evidence that humans will try to influence what someone else can see or hear, OK, which is getting quite into quite complex, uh, theory of mind social cognition. So I call on Tomasello say this, chimpanzees know what others know. In the sense that they can keep track of what another has just seen a moment before. OK, so what they're keeping track of is the, like the mental knowledge state of another chimpanzee just the moment before. And that moment before me is quite important. So here's the experiment. Again, it's quite cool. So normally in um like natural situations, if there's one bit of food, a dominant chimpanzee will get it. OK. So In this experiment, you use that kind of hierarchy as a manipulation, so you have a dominant chimpanzee and you have a subordinate chimpanzee. One cage here, one cage here. And then, don't worry about the triangles so much, it's all good. All you need to worry about here is that that circle represents a bucket. And that circle represents a bucket, and that little thing there represents a bit of fruit. I say banana, it looks like a banana. um. And you've got two conditions. One where the piece of fruit is on top. OK? So it's visible to both chimpanzees. The other where it's hidden inside the bucket. Now, the bucket is facing the subordinate. OK? So it's open like this, you're subordinate on the dominant. Um, it's facing like this and the, the bananas inside. OK? So here are the conditions that we have. We have visible 11 piece of food is on top of the bucket. Both chimpanzees can see that one bit of bucket, one bit of food, sorry. Hidden 11 piece of food is inside the bucket, so only the subordinate can see it. Hidden visible, there's one piece of food on top of one bucket and there's one piece of food inside the other bucket, OK? So in terms of procedure, the chimpanzees are kind of trained separately to understand that food might be on or in a bucket. We have to get kind of familiar with the, with the paradigm. And then when the experiment is run, the subordinate is always allowed out first. If you take, if you allow the dominant out first, there'll just be a fight and the dominant will take, get the food, right? So you allow the subordinate out first so it's not afraid, basically, to take the food. But the question becomes, does it just randomly take the food that's nearest to it? If it does that, that suggests that it has no real um awareness of the other chimpanzees state of mind, like, the knowledge state. But no, it does not. OK, so what it does is this. So here's the condition where you have the one visible, one hidden piece and versus the one visible piece. So two different conditions, but they're on the same figure. And we can see that when the um the chimpanzee, the subordinate chimpanzee is far more likely to take the food when it's hidden. Right, so it'll take the hidden piece, it's less likely to take the visible piece. You get an even more dramatic demonstration of this effect, where there's one piece of food that's hidden and one piece of food that's visible, so there's a choice of two. It will preferentially choose the one that is hidden from the doughnut. OK. So it kind of strongly suggests that they understand that the other chimpanzee knows where there is food, if they can see it, doesn't know there's food if they can't see it. OK, so they're gonna take the one that the dominant can't see because they don't want to get in a fight. OK. I'm not gonna read that out, but you can read it in your own time. It's kind of an aside, really. Um, again, it's about the issue with chimpanzee experiments. There are limitations because of the fact that they're semi-free ranging, because of the fact that they're a different species. Um, and that little paragraph there is basically saying, we've tried to do everything we can to be as rigorous as possible. If we start, if you, if you start kind of criticising the experiments for chimpanzees, you actually get into the same issue with criticising. The research with young infants. They are also nonverbal, they also have limitations, and it's kind of a retort against people criticising the primate research. So this is the issues of primate research. Things like finding the appropriate task and finding the right kind of form of motivation is very difficult. Testing environment has to be also lab-based. Um, issues with, um, personalities, you'd find with children, the same thing. But now we have issues of home human exposure and dominance hierarchies. Right? So it's kind of extra things that we don't find so much in the, um, child research. You also have to train them, right? So it's slightly differently from the kids generally is that in order to get them to learn a behaviour that's not natural, you need to train that sort of behaviour. Right? So with the bucket paradigm, they're trained that there might be food on a bucket or in a bucket. And you have to do that bit first. So that changes the design slightly. And again, the issue of no language. OK, there's no real usable language until kids are about 3. Alright. Very quickly, we're going to look at false belief understanding. But there's one more lecture in this series, so don't worry, we're not going to do everything here, um. Have you seen this before? Yes, good. Some of you remember it, that's good. That means I can go faster. Um, if you don't remember it, the slide should explain it to you. OK, so it's just go through them slowly. So in this scenario. This is now 15 month infants, so we're getting more complex, we're looking at false belief understanding, false belief being like the Sally Ann thing, right, false belief is like when um. You understand that someone else believes something to be untrue. Yes, it's kind of the basics of it. So in this experiment, there's a plastic piece of watermelon, there are 2 boxes a yellow and a green. All infants see this, all infancy, the experimenter here, put the watermelon into the green box, and then all infants, the screen comes up and all infants see, uh, put her hand in the green box as if reaching for the watermelon. So that's the familiarisation phase, similar to what you do with the chimpanzees, right? Training them to do a certain thing. The visor is there so she can't, so you can't see her eyeballs. It's not so she can't see, OK, so the children can't see her eyeballs. At that point, the infants are divided into 4 groups. We have true belief, true belief, uh, green, true belief yellow, and then false belief groups as well. So this is an eye tracking task, it's looking to see where the infant looks, if you remember. We're going with the idea that if the infant is surprised, they will look for longer. OK. True belief conditions are incredibly boring, so I won't spend time looking at them. Basically, the infant and the experimenter or the person here sees the same thing, right, so they all know where the watermelon is, which means that if the watermelon ends up in the green box, the infant should be surprised if she puts her hand in the yellow box. Yes, because she's wrong, and the infant knows she's wrong because she, the infant can has seen the same thing that she's seen. OK, so it's, it's not the complicated condition. Same for the yellow. If the watermelon moves into the yellow box, she puts her hand in the green box, the infant should be surprised and look for longer. The more interesting condition is when they have the false belief. All that happens in the false belief task is that the watermelon moves without the adults seeing it. OK? So the screen comes up and the watermelon moves across, so it's now in the yellow. So now, if the infant understands false beliefs, if the infant can keep track of the mental state of the adults, the infant knows that the watermelon is in the yellow box. If they are capable of false belief, the infant also knows that the adult believes that the watermelon is in the green box. OK? So the infant should be surprised if she puts her hand in the yellow box, even though that's where it is, right? That's where the watermelon is, but they should be surprised if they have false belief understanding, if the adult puts her hand in there, because as far as they know, The adult thinks it's in the other box, it's in the green box, OK? The yellow condition is the same, it's just a process first where everyone sees it move across and then you get that manipulation where only the infant sees it moves back the other direction. It's just to balance out the conditions. OK? And that's what you see, so hopefully you remember it from last year, is it 2nd, 2nd year I do it? What was it? 1st, 1st? No 2nd. I think it was 2nd. You don't do 1st and 2nd, do you? You you can't do it 1st and 2nd. We have an issue if you do. No no anyone remember? 2nd, definitely 2nd, thank you, everybody, that's fine. That's good, so you familiar. So what you'll remember is from the results is that um you see exactly what you'd expect to see if these 15 month old infants had false belief understanding. OK? Their looking time suggests that they can actually appreciate that the adult has a belief that is false. Right, the adult thinks it's here, I know it's here, but the adult thinks it's here, so they should put their hand in here. 15 months old. Bear in mind that they don't pass self recognition until 2. So you should be starting to think, ah, is this getting weird. Getting really weird. OK, there's evidence that infants can do quite complicated social cognitive abilities despite the fact that they don't seem to be able to understand that their body is their own body. OK, so does it say that we're wrong about the kind of hierarchical structure of social cognition? Does it say that the way we measure things, is it eye tracking, is it explicit? Is it a behavioural thing we're asking them to do, or is it an eye tracking thing we're asking them to do that may not be um. Purposeful, right? Important questions. So what about apes, do they track false belief? Um, how on earth would you test this? Well, simply by this, you have two chimps in competition. So it's a food competition task again. Now there's evidence to show that they can understand whether another chimp is informed or uninformed, right? That's the task we just saw with the hidden versus the not hidden food. And they can use that information to benefit themselves. But what about if the other team is misinformed? So if one piece of food is moved without the dominance knowledge, what happens then? So in this scenario, imagine exactly the same setup. And now there, there are two pieces of hidden food, right? Both apes see the two pieces of food put in one location. So 2 bits of banana, one location on top of a bucket, for example. But only the subordinate chimp, so either a screen comes up or a dominant goes away, only the subordinate chimp sees one of those pieces being moved to a new location. So one stays in the same, one stays to a one moves to a different location. Does the subordinate choose the piece of food that the dominant saw, in the original location, or does it choose a piece that was moved when the dominant couldn't see it? Now, if the chimpanzee can keep track of the other chimpanzees' um knowledge state, Right? Then they would be, it's not quite false belief, but it's very similar, they would be able to understand that the dominant chimpanzee knows that one's there. Even if it was hidden, they saw it being hidden, they know that one's there, they don't know that another one's over here. Right. Um, and basically, no. They don't. OK, this is, this gets more interesting next lecture, but hold on. Um, in terms of this kind of style of experiment, they do not seem to be able to keep track of that much information. OK, so as I say here, chimpanzees' behaviour in this experiment may reflect an inability to keep track of what others have seen with respect to two significant events. As they point out, this may simply be an information overload, so cognitive load, effectively. That reflects a genuine cognitive limitation, but not a limitation in judging what others have and have not seen. OK? So this is different from your classic false belief task and children where only one thing with its location. OK, so it's not a direct replication, it's not a direct copy of a false belief task. But in terms of there's no differences here, OK? Um, in terms of actually using that information to advantage themselves, they don't seem to be able to do it. Um He's a kind of summary, so they distinguish between an informed and uninformed competitor at a basic level. So that's what others know by what they've seen, but not between an informed and a misinformed competitor when the complexity increases. The question that's popping up here is, is that because they don't have false belief understanding? Is that because they can't track someone else's mental state? Or is it because they have a cognitive capacity, a cognitive load issue? Right, there's too much going on for them to keep track of. And it's slightly unclear whether it's one or the other. OK? Um, and that's a point to consider just for you before next lecture. I think that might be, that's it. Oh, did I finish on time? Oh, OK. Um, next, thank you very much. Next lecture, we're doing the 3rd in social cognition. And then the first in moral development. So we're going to swap topics halfway through, OK? Thank you.
