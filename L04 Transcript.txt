OK, did everyone have a chance to have a little coffee stretch, etc. Yes, OK, good, good. Really. By the way, can I, are there, how many people are there at the back? Not on uh lecture chairs, if you know what I mean. how many people are there? It's 12. Not many. 4, OK, 45, OK. I just need to know for the um. If we need to change venue, it's a bit of an issue. OK. Fantastic. OK. So We had a speedy look through heritability estimates and how you can use twins to do that. Um, and we kind of discovered that around 50% of all complex traits are heritable. So Lecture 4, we now look at the missing heritability problem. You'll find out about some interactions and wonder why we care. These are your learning outcomes, just to help you focus. Um, so the missing heritability problem, what is the missing heritability problem? And it is actually quite a big problem. So as we said, we all know that traits are heritable at around 50% ish, but finding the source. Of this heritability has remained very elusive, right? In other words, you get a big genome wide scan, um. And you don't really find much. OK, so first of all, replications of gene disorder associations are quite rare. So we had a big problem about 20 years ago where this kind of studies first started being done and lots of uh publications were coming out showing an association between, you know, this disorder or this trait and this gene. Everyone got very excited and then people started trying to replicate and didn't replicate. OK, so we had a replication issue. um, not always, but, obviously some things are um consistently found. But also the genome-wide scans or genome-wide studies that take huge, huge samples and look at everything across the genome. Also indicate that only tiny proportions of the variants, um, are related to common genetic variations, right? So they'll do a massive genome-wide scan and look for an association, say, with, uh, extroversion, which we might know from twin studies is 50% approximately heritable, and the amount of variants that's, um, found from these genome-wide scans is about 2 to 3%. So it identifies about, you know, genes that are responsible for about 2 to 3% of the variants. So that's the missing heritability problem. Is that the genes that we know are associated with certain um phenotypes represent about 2 to 3% of the variants uh due to genetics. So our twin studies are saying it's basically 47% missing. Right, so what is it? So, um, we've been fairly limited so far, really to working with, uh, the shared and unique environmental variables, and with the very, very few genotypes, um, that we've found to be reliably associated in terms of working with, I mean, it's the point of psychology, right? We want to understand these behaviours and traits, we want to be able to, um, understand where they come from, how they develop, what factors influence them. Um, etc. and it's very frustrating to only have a few little genes to play around with when you know there's so much more going on genetically that you don't understand. So what could the reason for the missing heritability problem be? Well, yeah, I'm gonna give you some options. Number one, maybe we're not looking at the correct genes. Very simple. So if you're doing a kind of, um, gene, uh, behaviour or gene trait analysis, you're simply going, I think this gene or this collection of genes is associated with this trait or this disorder, and I'm gonna see if they're related. So if you're wrong, right? If it's not those genes, you're not gonna find any relationship. So you might just be completely wrong. It also might be that you're not completely wrong, but you're just incomplete. Right there might be a missing part of your puzzle that means that you're not finding anything. It also might be to do the functionality of the genes, right? So you might have identified genes that you think are relevant, um, but they might not do exactly what we think that they do. OK? They're very complicated, right, so different receptors do different things in different parts of the brain. Same genetic code, they do different things. Um, based on their location. Right. So, um, it could be that the genes are doing what they, we think they do, but there might be lots of other genes doing things that interact with that as well. In other words, a gene network. Right, a network of genes that all work together to form a certain system. And we might be looking at part of that system, but unless we actually follow the whole system through, we're not gonna get the relationship with the phenotype that we're looking for. Yeah? Does that make sense? Basically missing parts of the puzzle, really. Um, it also might be that the proteins do, don't do what we think they do. So the gene that codes for a certain protein, and maybe we're slightly wrong about what that does, or we're looking in the wrong part of the body, etc. etc. Yeah. I've got a friend who does a lot of research in, he's a, um, psychiatrist, not by, not a medical one, but research psychiatrist. And, um, does a lot of work in anxiety and depression. And he's always quite funny because, obviously, there's a big interest at the moment in the gut, um, in the brain-gut relationship and in the gut biome, and in serotonin. And he always gets very frustrated because he's like, no, it's great, it's very interesting all the stuff doing in the gut. But that's not what anxiety is, it's, that's in your brain. Right, so he's always going, but the receptors in your brain and the way that serotonin functions in your brain is different. So it's very interesting when people have different perspectives on things, you know, yes, it's an exciting area, but then you get people who work in that area going, well, hang on. Let's actually work, let's figure it out, let's work it out. The other one is oxytocin, right? Really, really, um, really fascinating. I've done some work on oxytocin. Um, and again, big publication bias, huge publication bias about 10 years ago to be like it's the love drug, um, and all this, all this great stuff, uh. But also, I mean, I remember going to see a talk and they were presenting their research findings, um, where they have, this was a study, right, so the kids and the parents had a snort of oxytocin, how you deliver it, and right, basically. And um, they then measured oxytocin. Um, in both the, uh, parent and the child about, you know, 30 minutes later, through saliva, through spit, right? And they made this groundbreaking claim that they found that not only did that little this kind of inhalation of oxytocin massively increased oxytocin that was then released by the brain. Right, cos that's how it works, it doesn't go across the blood brain barrier, it kind of goes, I'm here through the nose at the brain barrier and then the brain barrier makes the brain makes some more, um, which sounds great, right, until you think about the nasal drip. So what they were measuring was their own oxytocin that was. Just literally coming through the nose into the spit, right, it's like oh come on, um. Doesn't mean to say they're wrong, it might be doing that, but the study was not doing quite what they thought it was doing. It can also be that, um, proteins don't influence brain function in the way that we thought he did. Right? So that's the kind of point I was making with the serotonin story with regards to the, the gut and the, uh, the brain. OK? So, and vice versa, right? We might know a lot about, uh, serotonin receptor in the brain, and it doesn't do that in the gut. Right? So what, we might be missing something because our knowledge is all based on the brain, we should be thinking about what it does elsewhere, for example. It can work either way. It can also be that we're not looking in the right samples. OK? So, this sounds weird, but samples need to be as pure as possible. So here's an example, right? Say you're interested in understanding impulsivity, right? The relationship between, um, a certain genes and impulsivity. Many different phenotypes look like that. OK? So, say, say you have, um, People with score high on impulsivity traits, people with a diagnosis of ADHD, people with executive control deficits, people with a traumatic brain injury, right? If you're not specific about what type of impulsivity you're looking at and how that impulsivity has been acquired, you're not gonna find anything, right? Because there you've got 4 different pathways to impulsivity. You have to specify as much as you can. And very carefully describe the phenotype that you're looking at. Yeah. Um, it's also can be that, um, the ethnicities of the samples have not been tracked properly, right? So, it doesn't matter what those, what the samples are, but you need to know because different genotypes are distributed differently in different ethnicities. Some aren't, right? Some are kind of boring, and they're the same across all the different ethnicities. We have a massive database that goes to kind of the multiple, all kind of, even down to the smallest kind of African tribe, looking at the distribution of these, um, lots of genotypes. Um, so it might be that you're. You know, in Caucasian person from France, your rare allele is there, on average, 20% of the time, right? But then it could be that in, uh, someone from the Masai Mara, it's there 80% of the time. And that's just the norm for those, um, ethnicities. OK? So, if you don't measure that, then you might get, um, false associations where there aren't any. It can also be that your range of descriptives is too large, so descriptives is stuff like um age, gender, ethnicity, blah blah blah blah SES etc. So when you're thinking about developmental disorders, age is really, really important, right? So, the example I'm gonna give you here is one of hearing. So maybe you're interested in genetics of, um, early hearing loss, right, or early, um, uh, hearing difficulties, whatever it might be. Now for sometimes it's not clear what it is, right, so a child who has continuous ear infections from very, very young, might have some hearing loss. Yeah. And that might not be resolved as being just due to ear infections until maybe they're 89, 10, they've had gromits, they've had all those things put in. And finally, they don't have ear infections all the time, and suddenly their hearing is fine, right? Compare that with someone who does have, um, a biologically based hearing loss, that's independent to an ear infection, right? You can measure those kids at the same time when they're 2 years old, because they both seem to have hearing loss, but they're different causes. Interestingly, by the way, um. I've heard er experienced clinicians say that one of the biggest predictors of child behaviour problems early in life is consistent ear infections. Right, if it makes sense, it makes sense, right, it sounds crazy but it makes sense. If you have a child, a little tiny one, toddler, even younger, you can't articulate what's going on, and they are in pain constantly, what are they gonna do constantly? Cry, scream, be grumpy, they become a difficult child, right, and they are because they're miserable, right? It's very hard to know they've got an ear infection, um, particularly when those ear infections are frequent. And on top of that, they can't hear you. Right, so it looks like they're not listening to you as they get older, it looks like they're being disobedient, right? Poor kid can't hear you. And on top of that, if they haven't heard properly while they're young, they can't articulate themselves properly either. Right, so something incredibly simple. Can have a really big impact, right, so it takes, sometimes it takes kind of outside the box thinking to go, well, hang on a minute, what is actually going on here? OK, so that's, you know, your descriptive range and your description of your phenotype and what you're looking at has to be really as quite as precise as possible. OK? So there's a toss up between getting as large a sample as possible and having exactly the, um, sample that you want. OK? It could also be, we're also maybe missing um finding what these genes are. We might not be thinking about it in the right way. OK, so we've mentioned gene gene interactions or like kind of a gene system approach. But we want to be a little bit smarter and think about actual um specific forms of interactions. So, what is an interaction? Does this like spark fear in you from like 2 year stats or whenever you, what it might do in a minute. Um, where one variable influences the relationships between two or more other variables. OK, that's what we mean by an interaction here. Does it, are you, have you now got that feeling? Scary mediation moderation feeling. What year did you do that? Was that 1st year, 2nd year? 2nd year? OK. It's OK. Um, so we're gonna have a little recap before we look at it in this context. So mediation, so mediator variables specify how or why. A particular effect or relationship occurs, OK? Think about a mediator, like as in if you've got like a court case, the mediators are the go-between, right? It's the mechanism for how or why. So here's a made up example, it is made up, for example, imagine the time spent doing homework. At school, it's associated with better exam performance. But this is mediated by the time spent doing practise papers. What that really means is that doing homework is only really associated with better exam performance because homework is associated with the more likelihood of doing practise papers, and it's that practise papers are the things that make you better at exam performance. It's made up. I'm just letting you, reminding you it's made up. Um, so it's like that, right? That's your mediator variable. It's explaining the relationship between a, sorry, between independent and dependent. So you find this relationship between C here and it's explaining what that is. So in terms of like a genetic interaction effect, um. Mediation in this context is normally referring to understanding the association between a genotype and a phenotype. So genotype being what your genes say, right, or the letters are. And the phenotype, the thing that you're measuring like a traitor. Um, diagnostic. So here's one that um I like because it's um. My work. Um, so serotonin 1B, polymorphisms are associated with callous unemotional traits, so they, you kind of, uh, child versions of psychopathic traits. So the question would be, so that's an interesting finding from my point of view, right? There's some kind of association there, but it means nothing. Like, why? Why is it there? What on earth is the relevance of that finding? Um, what is the real reason? Right? So, is it the effect of serotonin neurotransmission at certain places or certain regions of the brain? Is it to do with basic functions like cognition and attention? In other words, this mediating variable here is required to explain. The relationship between the genotype to the phenotype. OK. And without it, it's kind of difficult to know where to go from. It's got to be some kind of mechanistic understanding. So moderation is the other one. So moderation is a moderated variable, changes the strength of an effect or relationship between two variables, OK? So it changes the strength or direction for that point. money So, moderators indicate when or under what conditions a particular effect can be expected, right? So, here's this is an example from a paper, not one of mine, or anything like that. It's just an example. So a moderator may increase the strength of a relationship, decrease the strength of a relationship, or change the direction. So the one that's quite cool here is this is an interaction effect of drinking to cope. So they categorise people into whether they are high drinking to cope or low drinking to cope, as in drinking to cope with difficult situations, emotions, etc. And negative social contacts or a number of negative social contacts on the extent to which they drink when they're at home. Um, and so what you find is that for those with low, who reported low drinking to cope behaviours, as you might expect. Their drinking at home does not increase as the number of negative social contacts increases, right? That's not the cause of them drinking. Different association. But for those of you who do claim to drink to cope, I drink to cope people, as you might expect, the greater the number of negative social contacts, the more they are drinking. They are drinking to cope, right? If you took this division away, You'd be left with a flat light. Right, you don't understand anything. Just a completely flat line. Number of negative social contacts means nothing for how much people drink at home overall, right, and that's, that's not useful. Here's another example you can use in terms of thinking about um your own stuff, again, it's, it's made up. There may be a positive association between revising and exam performance for time periods of less than 120 minutes per day. But for time periods of more than 120 minutes, the relationship becomes negative. So what could explain that? Why might that happen? Edward doesn't know, he's just there. um, thanks, honey. It's made up, right, yeah? Yeah, exactly, it could be that you, you're now kind of too exhausted, right, and it gets worse, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Right let's just, yeah, go on. You got an idea? No, OK, thanks. OK doke. So when we talk about genetics, right, the kind of moderation effect we see in genetics will be a genetic um interaction effect. When a genotype or a genotypic effect changes the relationship between an environmental independent variable and a dependent variable, right? This is, in my mind, this is where things get really interesting and really worthwhile when it comes to genetic associations. Can this answer an important question? OK, so for example, we know that on average child abuse and maltreatment is associated with adult psychopathology. But not for everyone. Right, if it were, then we'd know what to do, but it's not, right? It's not that simple. So something you need to understand is this term called differential susceptibility. It's a very cool little thing, it comes from this kind of area of research. For some important outcomes, you have to take account of important genetic differences and parenting behaviours simultaneously. So you have to look at the interaction in order to understand at all what's going on, right? By the way, who knows what that is? Who said it, someone said it, say it. Yes, orchid, well done. We'll come back to why it is a flower, it is, it's an orchid. OK Um, so this is a kind of figure here showing you what differential susceptibility means in terms of environment genetic interaction. So the model says that the environment will have a different effect on you, depending on how susceptible you are. And it's not like you're, you're more or less, it's like you're this or you're that. Two things, right? So, for a highly susceptible child, This is there's that dotted line here, right? So this is the environment, negative, positive, this is the outcome negative, so for worse or for better, right? A highly susceptible child in a negative environment does really badly. Right? Um, a highly susceptible child, however, in a positive environment does really well. They do better than average. OK, so basically what they're saying is they're very sensitive to the environment in which they are raised in or, you know, experiencing at that time. There's a point to consider. In contrast, a low susceptibility child is this grey line here. OK. So they don't particularly benefit from an enhanced environment. They don't benefit from having a really great schooling, whatever it is. But at the same time, they're very resilient to having a really bad environment. But it doesn't really affect them in either way, what it's saying, right, they're not susceptible. Um, So we all come back to this. So here's a natural demonstration of this kind of study in practise. So this is from the fast track randomised control trial. OK, this is a massive, massive study that used high risk first graders. High risk can mean very different things depending on, um, which part of psychology you're talking about. Typically, it means a kind of combination of either, um, Risk in terms of very low SES criminogenic environment, that's often crime related, right? Um, in this context, it's, it's a combination of those two. OK, so. And a low SES environment, high crime rate environment, family members involved, etc. etc. So these are first graders and what they did is they looked at the, what gene variant they were at the NR3C1 gene. It's a glucocortico receptor gene, and it's involved in the social stress response. So how you deal with social stress. And they look, it's either A, A, A, G, G, AG or GG, um, and I believe A is the rare one, right? So G is the most common, I think we'll check that in a sec. And here's uh what they found, right, so come over to this little figure over here. So, these are kids uh about first graders around age kind of sevenish, I think, and they tracked them all the way to the age of 25. So these are outcomes at the age of 25. So they split them into those that were GG genetically, right, and those that carried an Aalele. Right, so carrier versus not carrier of the A-Lele. Um, so that can include people that had two copies of the A, right? It doesn't, doesn't matter as far as this is concerned. And then we have over here, these are our GG kids, right? These are our ones that are carriers of the A allele. The white bars here are the kids that were in the control condition. OK, so the control condition, basically, um. They weren't put into this fast track intervention, right? Um, they were just, you know. Waitlisted effectively. Um, the intervention itself was massive, right, the intervention was um very intensive, loads of support services, um. Kind of kind of everything's thrown at these kids to try and make them, try and make them kind of as as um. Resilient against risk as possible, right, so it was education, it was social services, it was everything. What we find is really interesting is that um for the GG carriers here, right, there's no actual difference between the kids in the control and the kids in the intervention. Right, this up here, this is the chance, this is the percentage of kids with any externalising disorder at the age of 25. OK, so the outcome is kind of risk for crime involvement really. Um, so 50% of the kids in the control group, 50% of the kids in the intervention, if they were GG carriers. Um, no effect of the intervention, however. And when you look over here, the kids that had the A allele, but those that weren't in the intervention, about 75% of those high risk kids with the A variant went on to develop psychological external rising problems by the age of 25, in contrast to only about 20%, 18% who those people in the intervention. So these kids are what we just saw in that graph just before. So orchids, the reason why these kids here, the A carriers are called orchid children, right, not specifically for this study, right, just the highly susceptible children are called orchid children. They are incredibly susceptible to the environment they are in. When they are not given an intervention and they're in a high risk environment, they do very badly. When they're given that environmental benefit, they do very well. Right. In contrast, do you know what the other ones might be called? It's really great. Go on, Ed, what is it? It's a I find it quite funny because I'm from England and these these grow everywhere. Go on. Yes, they will be too, she won't be happy about it, but they will be, yeah. They're kind of a weed, some people think they're weedy, go on. They are dandelions, you know, dandelions? Oh, well, she'll be very pleased you said. Um, yeah, dandelion is the other one, cause dandelions will grow anywhere. They're growing cracks in concrete. Bizarrely, we have carrots growing in cracks in our concrete. So I don't know what's going on. Yeah, we do. I know, carrots grow everywhere. It's really weird. Yeah, it's really weird. Anyway, sorry, beside the point, orchid children, yeah. It's, it's a complicated it's a confusing word to use actually, because it sounds like there's something inherent in them that makes them more susceptible. It's purely a genetic thing. So this is the gluco glucocorticoid receptor gene, um, and. But yeah, so they have, if they carry the A allele, um, there's something about the way in which their body effectively responds to stress, um, that's making them very susceptible, if you like, to their environment. No, it's purely genetic. Yes, so yes, sorry, so the orchid dandelion um nomen culture and the highly susceptible versus, you know, not susceptible refers purely to genetics in terms of, Environment, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So it's an interaction effect we're looking for, right? It's basically saying, um, what's the genetic effect depending on what the environment is. Yeah. Or the other way around, what's the environmental effect of depending on what the genetics is. It, no, it is, yeah, exactly, so that, you know, I've, I've never had an orchid because I'm, because of this reason. um, if you have a grown, anyone successfully grown an orchid? Some of you, well done. Anyone not successfully had an orchid? Yeah So they're very picky, right? They're very difficult. Obviously, once they thrive, they're beautiful. And that's the point. That's the, that's the reason they're being linked to these kids, right? If they, if they are given the correct environment, Woohoo, they blossom. If they aren't, then they don't do very well. Not, it's an interesting question, not necessarily potential, no, but they may be more likely to, um, respond to those kind of interventions that may develop that potential. Yeah. But then also, the mean, the, the, the ones that are kind of stable, there'll be variation within that, right? So if you're looking at academic attainment or something, you may have ones that are very stable. So they may be, they may be able to attain incredibly well, whether they're at the best school in the country or the worst school in the country, right? And there may be kids at the bottom who, you know, if you're looking at something like that, who, again, doesn't matter where they are, you know? And it's kind of slightly simple example, that one, but that's the yeah, that's the idea. So it's a really, really important thing to be aware of this kind of differential susceptibility idea because although the idea itself was just that, it was an idea, it has now been shown with behavioural genetics to be correct in terms of something simple like that. OK? More importantly, if you come back here, if you hadn't split by the allele. What, what would the results be of the intervention? Not great, yeah, pretty flat. Not great results. OK, so. You know, you would have had an effect of the intervention, um. A little bit Lower, maybe, but you wouldn't have had the same kind of effect that you see here. Yeah. It raises really interesting ethical issues though. This always comes up, so what kind of ethical issues does it raise, yeah? Yeah, exactly. You could say, well, you get, you could get this result and go, well, OK, so I'm gonna genotype the kids then. And all the kids in the society, I'm gonna genotype, and I'm only gonna give the intervention to the ones that the uh that the A carries because the other ones don't need it. So it's problematic, right? It's not, it's not, it's very interesting, it's very useful, but you have to be very careful with what you do with it. OK. So Let's be even smarter, what if we're looking at the right genes but not looking close enough? So what if there could be heritable changes in DNA? Have you just done this in your tutorial? Some of you haven't done it yet, who's had a tutorial so far? Have we done this? Was this what it was about? No, OK, good. That's good. As I said, I wasn't there cos I was with that guy. Um, who's heard of epigenetics? Yay, half, half good. Glad you have excellent. Um, so look. The really cool thing about epigenetics is this, is that it's functionally relevant changes to the genome that do not include a change in the nucleotide sequence. When I get to this part, I always find there's a point where. We have to go back and go, hang on a minute, what does DNA do? Are we all on the same page in terms of what DNA does and how it works? Right now, I'm not a geneticist, I'm not gonna try and teach you that, and I make, you know, be not totally 100% right, but I want to get everyone on the same page, OK? We'll get there in a second. I'm just gonna finish this bit. So, in other words, they're dynamic alterations to the transcriptional potential of a cell, right, it's transcription being the process by which the DNA is read, right? Um Methylation is probably the most common process we use to look at this, OK? So, here we go, we need a quick visual review of how DNA works, um. Questions to help you think about this, um. If you have a library, Right. If you have a, thanks, honey. If you have a library, right, and you've got 1000 books in there. How do you get the knowledge or the stories that are contained within those pages? You read them. Right, DNA. You read them. DNA is exactly the same. It doesn't do anything unless it is read, so. Let's do a quick visual review of DNA. Alright, Andres, you're, you're up. You're up buddy. Finally, you need, you need another um volunteer. I was gonna pick you because you're a little. Can you hold that one? standing up. Hold that. gotta hold it steady, Go come out here, so people could see.

SPEAKER 2
This is representing the We represent the DNA because it's

SPEAKER 0
a double he. So Obviously we've got a like like like in the textbooks it's all kind of elongated out your DNA so. Within the DNA somewhere, there will this between this green point here and green point here here, that's a gene. I said with that area of DNA, all the little AC.

SPEAKER 2
That's coding for a certain.

SPEAKER 0
Protein, right, that's the gene. The green bulb is what's called the promoter region. And the promoter region of the gene is basically where The baby toy is meant to be a transcription. Um, your transcription factor will bind on, OK, because nothing happens to the DNA, you'll expect you. Nothing happens to the DNA. Unless it's red. Just this bit, right, that's not making you you. It has to be read by something, and then that creates the RNA and that creates the protein, blah blah blah blah blah. OK. You got it. Well done, very, very good. Now, oh, wait there a minute because I've gotta do the next thing. Oh, OK, good. Are you say that. So if this is your DNA right? anyone guess what this is? Go on, it's called a bulldog. It's a bulldog. OK, correct. What is it? Not a mutation, now that would be if this changed, right, but this is epigenetic, yeah. It's not a good idea, it's not, so we're not gonna change anything to do with the DNA, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you said it.

SPEAKER 2
What's what's this?

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, exactly, he is very similar. This is the methyl unit. I'm gonna this is the mey unit. So methylation involves methyl unit binding onto the DNA. Right, so they stick on. So here's what we're gonna show. So what happens is, if, for example. Can you make it straight again. I and straight. That's still bro.

SPEAKER 2
OK, um, This is our isolation unit, so this is

SPEAKER 0
our. Uh, transcription unit which is gonna eat read our DNA. It's like a bug on a stick. The bug walks along the stick. It eats the stick, and when we get to the end of the gene. Spits out the protein, right? If methylation units are in the way, it makes it harder for it to stick on the stick. I'm sure there's a lot more in terms of the biochemistry, but as far as we go with our understanding of methylation, it just makes it harder for that gene to be. Right, OK, that makes sense. I Thank you. You can take that with you because I'll need you again in a minute, OK? So if you get lost, come back to the idea of this bug on a stick, your DNA does nothing, nothing unless it's red, OK? So, Multiple things can cause methylation. So methylation is an increase or decrease actually, in the amount of methyl um binding to your DNA. And it can be different in different parts of your body, different parts of your brain. Um, generally, people look at overall methylation. But things like stress, diet, um. Extreme kind of conditions which we'll see in a minute, can change the amount of methylation. Right, which changes if this thing isn't red, it doesn't make the protein. If that protein is a certain type of receptor, for example. In your brain you have fewer of them. Yeah. OK. This guy's just talking about um very specific effects that they've shown and they've demonstrated remethylation.

SPEAKER 3
November 2010 interesting interview in functional medicine update with Doctor Moya Sev from the McGill University uh Laboratories on stress. You might recall that it was one of the most profound closes in that interview and that I asked him the question whether epigenetic patterning in children that had been exposed to war and violence could influence the rest of their life in terms of post traumatic stress syndrome, and he went on talking about the global implications of stress in children and how that might uh silence certain genes and and alter gene expression patterns throughout the rest of our lives and this is kind of a. Uh, a way that one could actually see social pathology occurring through, uh, a genomic expression patterning with a very, very, uh, traumatic environment. So with that as a context, some days things happen that just open your eyes to say wow, and that's this article that just appeared, uh, in September of 2014 and the journal PLOS One again from the laboratories of uh Doctor Moyaev and his colleagues. At the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University Psychosocial Research Division and the Douglas Hospital Research centre again focusing on epigenetics and in this case the story is equally intriguing and interesting. This has to do with the ice storm in Quebec, Canada in 1998, a period of time where there was power outages and people huddled at home trying to keep warm with no um heat. And very subzero temperatures for an extended period of time. So the question was, what about women that were pregnant during that period of time? Could that have had any impact being exposed to that very hostile cold condition on their offspring? And lo and behold, in this particular study, they went and they evaluated the methylation patterns in uh T cells. Uh, these are the immune cells in their body that are turning over fairly rapidly. And looked at the uh these methylation patterns in the promoter regions of genes and lo and behold in these children that were conceived uh during the ice storm in 1998 in Quebec, they found extraordinary differences in their methylation patterns than that of children that were born without that stress of pregnancy. And what are those loci that are related to the methylation patterns and none other than uh conditions that relate to immunity and conditions that relate to insulin signalling. Which suggests and it's still early on because these kids are just in their teenage years now uh that possibly we should be looking at increased prevalence of diabetes and other immune related problems in these children. It's not their genes that will be the problem. It will be the way their genes are expressed as a consequence of the exposure in utero to a very hostile environment, in this case extreme cold. These are opening all sorts of questions about the interface between sociology and biology, sociobiology and its relationship into the expression of patterns throughout our lives that we would call our disease patterns. These children who may have actually very good genes may be locked into a certain kind of expression pattern that needs very special attention by altering their later stage diet lifestyle and environment to minimise the expression of these characteristics that are locked in during their pregnancy in utero experience, a very powerful example of what's happening right now in this personalised lifestyle healthcare movement.

SPEAKER 0
So the, sorry, so the main idea there being the gene expression is different, right? So their genes aren't doing anything, it's the fact that their gene expression has been changed by the environmental impact. OK, so that's the kind of point of methylation and epigenetic effect. So epigenetics, I think is, you know, very, very exciting area. Um, we see, if you look kind of in the news recently in social media, there's a lot of interest in not just kind of, uh, gain gut brain. Relationships, but also in things like the impact of things like inflammation on mental health, like we know that exercise is one of the best, if not the best, it's the best, um, evidence-based treatment for anxiety and depression. Exercise. Right, so we know there's an association between, um, how our bodies function. Um, in terms of health in all different ways and, uh, aspects of our psychology. And uh epigenetics or methylation is, I think one of the ways which might kind of help explain some of these processes. It's also quite cool that the genotype alone does not dictate gene expression. Right, so when we come back to that nature nurture debate, this is why the nature nurture debate is over. Right, because they interact. Your environment impacts your genes and their expression, your genes impact the environments in which you um expose yourself to. So epigenetics is on this very basic level of mechanism for gene environment interaction. It also provides a challenge in the um. There are even more interactions that can develop, OK, so for example, there are some studies to show that there can be genotypic effects on methylation. So the genes that you have. Influence the extent to which that gene or other genes are methylated. Right, so in other words, thinking about that kind of susceptibility thing, if there are genes which say you're gonna be less methylated than somebody else, right? Purely genetically, that's a potential process. Um, the other kind of complexity is DNA structure and, oh, I need more volunteers. You're up, Ed, you're up. You're back on. We'll get you. It's a long time. It's a long time, 2 hours when you're 8 and you. There's I'm just on I'm not sure that I actually need another volunteer for this one. Well, let me pick. Well, they might, you can't pick someone who doesn't want to do it. OK. Anyone want to be a volunteer? Yay!

SPEAKER 2
That's it, that's your. OK Yeah but you're gonna have to come forward so

SPEAKER 0
you can see other, OK. Now listen, you've got to hold this really tight. So not not that You have to set up OK,

SPEAKER 2
so How DNA looks through textbooks when you're in high

SPEAKER 0
school, yeah? The the front of your textbook always has that beautiful thing that you just go um. Reality, of course, it does not look like that. Now one of the really interesting things I think about the, you know, the um genome wide scans. Sometimes they go and they go this little area of DNA over here, for example.

SPEAKER 2
It has absolutely nothing to do He's up.

SPEAKER 0
I'm related to. It's not even Ran a bit of DNA.

SPEAKER 2
OK.

SPEAKER 0
And we forget that it's worth remembering You need to hold it really tight, both hands. You get off the chin. Get off the chin. You just get off or I'm gonna do it for you. You know that I Oh, it really tight because you can't let go of. So sorry, they also do the same thing as scan but they find me. Well, ventilation. See Get tight. What I need you to do now is you stay still, you take a big. OK. You ready?

SPEAKER 2
So do you see that's what, that's what you actually.

SPEAKER 0
OK it's So if you see right now between our little. interested in. What's touching the green bits? Reservation, right?

SPEAKER 2
that seems to be nowhere near The physical structure of

SPEAKER 0
DNA is incredibly complicated. You get charges from the hydrogens.

SPEAKER 2
I have not Basically causing In the whole of the

SPEAKER 0
larger DNA structure, OK, so I think that's quite an exciting possibility is that methylation in different areas. Go sit down for me. Thank you very much. Is that methylation in different areas. Might actually be related to the genes that we're interested in, but through structure, OK, rather than anything else. OK. I think it provides hope. Because it's dynamic. Not always, I mean, not always, right? So methylation can sometimes be sped up, it can be slowed down, it can be reversed. Not always, not always. um. It's interesting in that I think it also might shed light. So think back to Piage who talked about critical periods in development, right, periods at which things had to happen or they would never develop. Is this the kind of mechanism that can explain what he was talking about? Does some sort of a certain level of methylation need to occur by a certain date in order for A, B, or C to occur, or does there need to be a lack of methylation in order for A, B, C to occur? It's a question. I think it's a really interesting question for research, um, and I think it's very exciting. OK, mainly because it's based on the understanding of gene function rather than just what it's, you know, the DNA in there is, it's actually looking at the function of the gene itself in the body, OK? Ooh, this is, this is not in your canvas. Don't go to canvas. But I had it in there anyway, so I'm added it in. OK, can you go and sit down, please? I need to finish my lecture. Thank you. OK, thank you, buddy. So, which of the following is an example of moderation? Is it A, coffee makes you more efficient because it makes your neurons fire faster? 1 to 3 cups of coffee increases efficiency. 4 or more coffees reduces efficiency as too much caffeine drizzles your neurons. Coffee makes your neurons fire faster, which is why when you have too much, your neurons drizzle. There is no such thing as too much coffee. Um, and coffee consumption is directly proportional to the number of weeks into the semester. Um, who votes A? Is that moderation? Coffee makes your neurons fire faster. Me. Who votes B 1 to 3 cups of coffee increases efficiency 4 plus oh, who votes C? Coffee makes you of neurons by far which is why when you have too much of neurons result. D. There's no such thing as too much coffee. Or E. OK, you were correct, it is B. Um, the other ones are mixing up, uh, mediation. OK, this is explaining why Coffee makes you more efficient because it makes your neurons fire faster, that's mediation. Same with C muddling up the two. Makes your neurons fire faster, which is why when you have too much and you think, oh, it's gonna be moderation, and then it gives an explanation. OK? OK, last thing, why do we care? OK? Why do we care about the role of epigenetics of genetics, interaction between the two? We care fundamentally because we are scientists. OK, so this is the way I like to think of things. Upside down. I don't know why we call it an upside down triangle. Who said a triangle had to be the way up. Anyway, it's a triangle, when as psychologists, we're generally looking at this level, OK? We're generally looking at behaviour and personality traits. OK, I do apologise, as I said, he does actually have ADHD and he's finding it quite tricky, but he's doing very well on you. So far. Um, so we have behaviour at the top. That's generally what we're looking at in psychology, personality traits. Sometimes we'd go down to the cognitive and emotional abilities. The really important thing though is that they're very broad, right? Loads of behaviours fit into the same kind of phenotype. So imagine hundreds of these triangles all overlapping. If you look only, if you're only interested as a psychologist in these levels here, You're going to get so much overlap in terms of mechanism between multiple different things. The lower down you go in this triangle, the less those triangles overlap, right, until you get to the very point at the bottom. You have to add in, of course, the causal pathway. Right? Because that's what we're talking about. We're talking about the causal pathway from biology to, um, Psychology, effectively, with the environment at every single step of that phase, environment and genetics are epigenetics, all the way up to environment uh interacting with personality traits and cognitive abilities. And time, you look at development, we add in the time as well. OK. That is a link to, I think it still works. That's a link to the iTunes you, Robert Sapolsky. He does a really whole interesting thing about aggression, um, and social interaction. You're not in it. Um, and it's, uh, it's quite a good watch. Like, genuinely a good watch, make it like a fun date thing. Um, next week, we are looking at social cognition, so a complete change, OK? So feel free to go over what you've done in the last two weeks. Um, now, before we move on to social cognition, yes, we on medium. Thank you everybody, I promise you there'll be no children next week. If it's, at least if it's my daughter, it'll be fine. No.

SPEAKER 2
OK. Bye. Hi Carla, I'm. OK I'm gonna. Yeah Oh I. That's also. Goodbye. You OK, but, but we know that there's 50% variance. Yeah OK. OK. Right, OK, so, yeah, got it. Um, have a have a lovely afternoon. Mummy I said hi in there.

SPEAKER 0
OK, can you gather all your stuff together? No, no, no, you need to talk to these people.

SPEAKER 2
Do you, I'm looking for some like research assistant sort of stuff because I'm only part time. potentially, yeah, I'm actually looking to DNA.

SPEAKER 0
Everyone, come. Yeah, I am.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. Um. OK yeah Oh There's no one listening anymore. That's true. No thank you. Uh yeah, I also help out with as well there's anything, um, when do you reckon like you'd be looking for like yeah, I've just come back from sabbaticals by

SPEAKER 0
the way. OK Oh, thunder.

SPEAKER 2
Um, maybe a little.

SPEAKER 0
I haven't yet to quite figure out how I'm gonna do it, I've got one ethics that I got one. Should I send you an email or send an email. That sounds great.

SPEAKER 2
Thank you so much. Oh, I have. Hello. Oh G Mm. Nothing, nothing, uh, don't change at all. Right, but they do not change the um the so if um yeah it was yeah, so it's like if you have lots of methylation, it can block the transcription factor.

SPEAKER 0
Even if they're kind of on different reasons that. by Can I. Actually means that charges in different places do have rules on places that seem on the strand far away, but it's because it's so.

SPEAKER 2
Some.

SPEAKER 0
They do, yeah, but the whole the whole Everyone. It's not like the whole strands.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah yeah it's still like this right there. I see, um, the second question is regarding. Yeah I'm looking for a 301 13. So I'm 10 a.m. Mondays and I'm 1.

SPEAKER 0
One of those is 3916, but the other one is 301. Yeah, one's one's at 10 a.m., one's at 1.

SPEAKER 2
One's at 10 a.m.? Yeah, I'm telling p.m. Monday.

SPEAKER 0
No, no, Monday. 10 a.m. Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, so is there any I think it's I think

SPEAKER 0
it's one at the same time, isn't it? Yeah, I'm currently in the one at the same time

SPEAKER 2
what?

SPEAKER 0
To be honest, I don't know because I was meant to do it yesterday, but because this guy had surgery, I, I was off yesterday so I didn't do it,

SPEAKER 2
um. OK. I live in and I had a question about methylation. Are there different types of methylation or is it just different patterns like location?

SPEAKER 0
generally Attached to DNA, but there are other forms of etic changes, so the histone can change with a more structural, um. Uh, and you know Yeah Um, but methylation itself is quite. The difficult thing is that people kind of always assume that more methylation means bad. That's not always the case. Sometimes less is bad, um, it just depends on the genome where it is. It's just a process that changes Yeah The more methylation

SPEAKER 2
is.

SPEAKER 0
generally, yeah, not always again, probably because of the structural issues, yeah, exactly, so um. Generally that's what you find when you kind of go through the literature, yeah, the more motivation because it's, it's kind of linked with stress. Did they? Oh, what's in it?

SPEAKER 2
And Oh Who's it actually?

SPEAKER 0
Oh, bring it down, Ed, bring it down. Well spotted. There someone. Um, Thank you for that Like Natural thing or. Um, how it occurs in terms of I'll check with that in a minute, OK? Um, how it goes in terms of. Excess or Um, It's a very good question, so um. where the new units come from is a good.

SPEAKER 2
OK, can I keep this, um, probably the best answer

SPEAKER 0
other than. Um your best answer would be to. Um, biochemistry of one of the things that kind of

SPEAKER 2
look at all the kind of things and look at

SPEAKER 0
and they tend to find in that kind of in that. But um I don't think those ties are gonna say. How it's related. So if it's one specific one you're interested in that one. And you probably have to read a bit of bit

SPEAKER 2
of biochemicals. Yeah I mean it's probably just breakdown of.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah To I Yeah, I, I could finish in bits

SPEAKER 2
of it, but it's, it was talking about the same thing with like gene and gene expression and like so. Yeah yeah I know that. I think in upbringing that and then some.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, in the good upbringing and they actually had like

SPEAKER 2
it wasn't so much a problematic it was like a high potential and it's really good upbringing. Like, not like it was another.

SPEAKER 0
I am Carola.
