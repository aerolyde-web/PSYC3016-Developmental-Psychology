All right, everybody, my, uh, my little light has gone red, which means that I have to start. OK? So we have the second moral development lecture first, and then we have a kind of slightly standalone lecture on, uh, kind of anti-social behaviour, conduct problems in kids. Where to start. OK, so. As we go through this final of two lectures in moral development, keep thinking back to social cognition as well. There's a lot of overlap, a lot of relevant concepts in here. Um, do you remember last time we were looking at more of the reasoning side, the cognitive reasoning, we're looking at Kohlberg and the reasons people, especially kids think they should do one thing or another, right? And we have this kind of different stages of, of moral development in terms of cognitive. Uh, moral development. What we're looking at now is kind of slightly more towards the other side, so more of a sentimentalist tradition, which is more looking at emotion and um empathy and that kind of thing. And then we'll kind of try and merge the two a little bit towards the end. So here are some readings that are recommended. They are not required. OK, you don't have to read these. It's only if you are particularly interested or you want to understand a bit more. Um, these are kind of seminal works that we'll look at, um, some of the works in here we'll look at today. These are your learning outcomes uh for later on. And we're gonna start here. So, um. To begin this little lecture, which is interesting to look at a similar thing next lecture, is uh kind of look at a developmental model, um, from psychopathy. So psychopathy being low levels of guilt, shame, um, empathy. So, here's the thinking, right? This is thinking mainly of a guy called James Blair, um, who kind of thought, look, I think psychopaths are impaired in their ability to form associations between their behaviour and socially relevant cues. In other words, aversive, unconditioned stimuli. In other words, Children with high levels of psychopathic traits or adults, um, as well. If they do something that causes someone else to cry, for example. They haven't, according to Blair, they have an inability or an impaired ability to form a connection or an association between their own behaviour and that kind of, uh, stimulus like that, but these are called naturally aversive stimuli, right? So someone else crying, screaming, that kind of thing is an aversive stimulus typically. So what he was saying is that in people who are not um high in psychopathy, things like violence and aggression are actually overcome by processes of sympathy and empathy, right? So the, the motivation to be violent or aggressive. It's kind of stopped in its tracks by. A response to the other person's um behaviour or expression of fear or sadness. So central to this hypothesis was something he called the violence inhibition mechanism or the VI. And he considered it to be a cognitive mechanism. Um, so, effectively, what happens, according to Blair's hypothesis regarding the FIM, is that for people without high levels of psychopathic traits, this, um, mechanism is activated, right? By not verbal and nonverbal communications of distress. And that initiates a withdrawal response. OK? So in other words, for your average child, um, they're in the playground, they want someone's ball, they take someone's ball, that's your act of aggression. The other kid cries, um, and that initiates a withdrawal response in the other child, OK? And they might start to feel bad. Um Consistent with this is that it, I mean, old old researchers observed that display of distress cues, so sadness, um, fear, etc. does actually result in the termination of aggression in 4 to 7 year olds. So young kids will modify their behaviour in response to an emotional expression. Yes. Say it again. Mm. Yes, exactly. So in, in just your typical child, typical, not necessarily at all ages, but your typical child, um, this kind of violence inhibition mechanisms is meant to be just that, it inhibits violence, right? By, um, kind of this is the association between the subversive cue and your own behaviour, and that adversive cue stops, stops the behaviour. So to kind of begin testing this hypothesis, um, James Blair looked at, uh, basically the ability of these boys with psychopathic tendencies. We now call these callous unemotional traits typically. In this study, they're using measures of psychopathy, so they, you know, you can't call them callous unemotional traits. Um, so what we have here is we have, uh, boys with high levels of psychopathic tendencies. And we have a comparison group matched on age. So they differ on all these things. They differ in terms of the anti-social process screening device, callous unemotional traits themselves, impulsivity, narcissism, um, and actually IQ. So the psychopathic group is slightly lower IQ than the comparison group. Are you aware of that uh People of again, due to media, people often think that psychopaths are high IQ. Have anyone heard that before? Anyone thought that before? Yeah, psychopaths are high IQ. It's complete rubbish, right, they're completely the same as everybody else. The reason people think they're high IQ is because when you look at the prison population. Right? Those with psychopathy are generally more average IQ. Those without psychopathy are lower IQ. Right, so the psychopathic group is the higher IQ group within correctional facilities, typically. Right, so they're higher, they're still normal. Obviously that any range can exist, right? Um, and here is what they looked at in terms of vocal affect recognition. So this is the ability to recognise the tone of voice, right? The emotion expressed in tone of voice. Other studies since then have looked at, um, recognising this in the emotional expressions, in faces, in body posture, found a very similar result, which is that those with high levels of psychopathic tendencies, um, make, either make more errors, um, or just less good at getting the correct answer. Specifically for fear. OK, meta-analysis now suggests it's both fear and sadness. So those kind of unconditioned stimuli that should produce this withdrawal response, um, are poorly recognised by those with high levels of psychopathic traits. So that was kind of Blair's first uh reason to go, well, hang on, they, they don't recognise these things very well. Maybe that's why they don't respond to them. OK? They don't recognise them, how do you form an association with them and how does that, you know, modify your behaviour? Um, so to look at that, they asked whether in kids with kind of high levels of these, uh, psychopathic traits. Whether um. This kind of, this kind of inability, this violence inhibition mechanism was related to their ability to make that moral conventional distinction. So we talked about moral prescriptions and social conventions, and typically children very early can recognise that they're different, they're kind of different qualities about the two of them, right? So they're looking at this kind of the impact of maybe this faulty processing in the development of moral um understanding. So they had kids from uh school for EBD kids, so emotional and behavioural difficulties. Um, all boys, these are kids that are too behaviorally problematic for mainstream education. It's not necessarily learning disability or in any, any form like that, it's behaviorally too difficult. OK, so aggression, aggression and violence. Um, they were then screened with the psychopathy screening device and Put into a high, medium and low group, they then got rid of the medium group, right, they're looking for extremes so they're looking, they got rid of the medium group. And what they find 1st, 1st of all, so these are your high psychopathy scoring boys, these are your low psychopathy scoring boys, matched on age, matched on verbal ability. These don't match up very well, so you don't need to worry about the actual contents of these because I'll tell you the results. Um, but it's looking at different, um, sorts of qualities to do with M stands for moral prescriptions, so not hitting people. C stands for social convention, so it's sitting on the carpet, for example. And overall, um. Overall, all the subjects didn't say that conventional transgressions or social conventions were any more allowable or permissible than the moral transgressions, but they did judge them to be less serious and more under the jurisdiction of authority. So in other words, kind of rule-based, yeah, more to do with what was told, what you're told to do. However, and this is where the interesting bit comes in, is that the boys in the highest psychopathy group. They made far less of a distinction between the two, than the low psychopathy group. OK. So for seriousness, for example, it's the one that matches up here, um, We have uh the numbers that you see between the high and the low groups are very similar for moral for a social convention, sorry, the C stands for social conventions. The difference comes out here, so the, the difference between these two is much higher than the difference between those two significantly so. OK? So it's not that they're rating social conventions lower. They're not rating everything lower. They're just rating moral breaking a moral prescription as less serious. OK? So there seems to be some sort of relationship between psychopathic traits and kind of failing to see moral prescriptions or breaking those things that's particularly serious or outside the boundaries of rules. And then it's something a bit naughty that you're not really meant to do in research, but it's, well, I'll forgive them because it's school. So they turn the question around. Ask the same question from the same group. Um, if you group people into the extent to which they make a moral versus a social distinction, does that predict psychopathic traits? In other words, can you predict how psychopathic a boy is from the way they compare those two types of transgressions? And quite simply, yes, you can. OK, that's what they found. So age and verbal abilities is matched for the people that they've allocated them to failures and passers, right, in terms of, um. You know, the score they get on these kind of moral conventional distinction measures. So passes will be the one that make a decent discrimination between the two, failures are not making a good discrimination between the two, as the criteria shown here. And what you find is that no significant difference related to age or verbal ability, but when you look at um psychopathy screening device score, um. Motivational facets and interpersonal facets, there's a significant difference between the two groups. OK, so you've got failures are scoring higher on those measures. OK, so, you know, interesting, there's some kind of actual human behaviour that's related to the ability to make this distinction, um. So what Blair said at the time, this is a while ago, what he said at the time was that the violence inhibition mechanism, therefore. He argued was the reason for psychopathy, right, this inability of this, this mechanism of failure, right, the failure of this mechanism to inhibit violence in response to a kind of effective um aversive cues was the reason, so. Psychopathy is associated with the inability to feel empathy with the victim. Not only does theI interrupt violent action online in the context of distress cues, but it also developmentally inhibits violent action. The child with the violence inhibition mechanism will be negatively reinforced following any action that results in the display of distressed cues by a victim. The child without a violent inhibition mechanism would not be negatively reinforced. He would therefore be much more likely to show violent tendencies from an early age. Psychopaths are associated with considerable violent tendencies from an early age. OK, that's the quote. Um, I know James Blair. We're part of the same society, and, um, he's very nice, very, very nice man. Um, very English, like, way more English than me, and talks about twice my speed as well, so just, you know, be aware. Um, but he's fabulous. And he, I was having a chat with him a few years back, and he says he doesn't believe this is true now. OK. Um, and that's, that's a really important point to make. If you're in research. You're only a good researcher if you can do that. If you can say I had this idea, and I thought it was good and I published it, and I found evidence to support it, and now I don't think it's right anymore. And you have to be able to go, oh no. Not good enough, right, doesn't explain everything. And that's the only reason really, there's, I think they're very, very good elements in this theory, in this model. It doesn't explain everything for reasons you will see in the next lecture, OK? So for example, we know that kids with high levels of psychopathic traits are able to feel empathy. They are able to respond to cues, they are able to identify emotional cues, right? It's, it's a slightly more complicated picture. So this kind of research is part of the sentimentalist tradition, right, which is um. Basically saying that, um, it's looking at the empathy, um, feelings, emotions and how they relate to moral behaviour. So I'm adding in Darwin here cos I think you should have had him in your first year lectures, did you? A little look at Darwin, um. So Darwin actually proposed something really similar, um, because he thought we were driven by different sorts of instincts, he called them. So we had the social instincts, which are described here as constant and moderate, but they're actually the stronger ones. He was arguing that these social instincts are kind of constant, and they're, they're the drive, really, that kind of social connectedness drive. And then you have these appetites, on the other hand, which are, you know, very sudden and quite strong, but they don't last very long. Right? So hunger, aggression, etc. Um, I won't read this out to you because you can read it yourself, but effectively what Darwin argued was something very similar, which is that people are generally kind of going throughout life with this, um, kind of social sympathy, goodwill, he calls it this kind of social affiliative drive. And every now and again this appetite will come in, right, and a little overthrow and it'll be more powerful, and you'll behave in response to that appetite. And then what he argues is that you suddenly get this feeling of dissatisfaction, which is that this, the appetitive one has kind of, uh, reduced and the other one is coming back up again. And that feeling of disconnect between the two is what kind of shame or remorse is, and that was Darwin's suggestion. And he argues that it's that regret or remorse and how unpleasant it is, right, that is part of the way in which development teaches us to control those appetites, that aggression, etc. Which fits in with, with, um, Blair, right? Because if you don't have that. If you don't feel that remorse, if you don't have that connectedness with the emotional side of things, then it's understandably difficult to develop behaviour that is less antisocial. OK, so in these kind of theories, children are moral because they are empathic, or something similar to that. So one challenge is to find out how empathic children actually are. One problem we have though is just because we feel something, right? Just because we feel pity or empathy doesn't mean we're gonna act on that feeling. So, in other words, you can think of behaviour in this context as how we communicate what we feel, right? And there may be other elements in there that, you know, alter things from how we feel about something to what we actually do. Um, so more recently, the focus has been on the children's ability to identify and evaluate simple reasons for people's actions. So don't, we're not quite back at Kohlberg here, OK, because we're looking at children's capacity to identify the intentions motivating people's actions, right? Not the what should I do, but what is someone trying to do? Right? What were they trying to do? And if you come back to your social cognition lectures, um, this has got to do with theory of mind, right, and social cognition, because, um. If The main kind of focus of moral behaviour is understanding someone's intention, you make a moral judgement on someone based on certain things, like what they've done. But also what their intention was, right? Yes, no. It's a very interesting thing currently, it's a very interesting question because we've got a bit wonky in this whole regard over the last decade, um. But the idea is that that's a kind of moral decision, right, or a moral judgement is made on understanding the intentions of somebody else, which requires that ability of social cognition. So Kohlberg, if you remember, on these different kind of stages of moral reasoning, define kids' morality as one of, you know, bounded by certain, um, justifications, right? So either consequences, remember the first two levels, either if they've done something bad, if they're punished, that must have been they've done something bad. Um, if it's rewarded, that's that's, that's good, good for me, um, or in terms of social conventions or norms, yeah. What would society expect me to do? So if you ask a child this question, right, if I ask you this question, who is naughtier, right? Is Chris, Chris breaks one cup doing something naughty. Billy breaks 15 cups accidentally. Who thinks, OK, hands up, who thinks Chris is naughtier? Who thinks Billy is naughtier? Right. Under the age of 7. Billy is judged to be naughtier and more deserving of punishment than Chris. Despite the fact that he's begged that it, it was accidental, right, maybe he fell over, right, and broke 15 cups that he was carrying. So under the age of 7, children kind of, they value the outcome. They really look to to judge the outcome. Um, but that comparison isn't really fair, right, because we need to fill in the little, little, uh, other two parts of the square. So, in other words, you can think of that example we just had as a comparison of low damage versus high damage. So, severity of outcome, really. Right? Was it, was it a minor outcome or a major outcome? Um, and then low intention, which is accidental, no intention, versus high intention. So doing it on purpose. Yeah? So when you fill in these things, it turns out that young children They do privilege outcome, OK? But they're not blind to the intention either. So they judge B worse than C. Yep, so they're overvaluing the outcome here. But they also judge C worse than A, right? So they judge if the outcome is the same in terms of damage, then they'll rate the naughty one as more naughty and more deserving of punishment than the one that did it on by accident. Um, and the same over here, so you, if the damages remain the same. So 15 cups, they'll still rate the one that did it because they're being naughty as more naughty, right, than the one that did it accidentally. So you've got this kind of, they're using both sorts of information, they're using outcome and they're using, um, intention. Yeah. Yeah, so the question was, is this under 7 years of age? Yes, this is under 7 years of age, yeah. And we'll look at what happens. Um. So they do balance motive, um, and they do, but they do privilege outcome, right? So they're taking, using both bits of information, but not in the same way an adulthood. So in fact, when you look at whether a child um is judging someone to be a nice or nasty person. From about the age of 5, they do show some capacity to associate the actor's intentions with his or her kind of traits, right? This is great. I love this study, it's it's great. So in this study. There are multiple scenarios, but this is one example here. Um, we have Timma, who's the actor, plays with a hose and hits a shearer, the recipient, with water. So that happens every time. But what they do is they manipulate now the intention of Tima, OK? And the outcome. So, for example, Timma plays with the hose and hits Ashira with water, and the outcome is either Ashira is happy because she was really hot and wanted to cool off. OK, so a positive outcome. Or ashira is upset because she's in a hurry to get somewhere and will have to change clothes. That's a negative outcome. Right, same behaviour, negative outcome. We then have different levels of motive, right? So positive motor motive is that Tima thought that Ashira would be happy to cool off. Right? So they, they thought it would be a good thing to get Ashira wet. Negative Tima thought that Ashira would be upset about getting wet, so they're purposefully doing something that they think they won't enjoy, they won't like, so a negative one. Or incidental, Tima wanted to have fun shooting water all around, right? So no intention to do anything to Ashira. They then looked at different age cohorts of children into adults, adults to see what the answer to this question was. Do you think the agent, so in this case, Timma, is a nice or a mean person? OK? So mean is down here, so the lower the bar, the more mean, the higher the bar, the nicer they're rating the person. We have kindergartners, so, you know, 456, 2nd grade, 5th grade, and then adults as well. Now here, PIN stands for the positive motive, so that's the motive of Tema, the agent. Um, positive, incidental, so accidental versus negative, and the black bars are when the outcome itself was positive. Right, versus a negative outcome. Now if you look over here first of all, in adults, you get kind of what you'd expect, right, which is that when the motive of Tima was positive, when Tima thought that it was a good thing to get ahira wet, it doesn't matter what the actual outcome was. Right, they rate Tina as being equally nice. Right, it doesn't matter what the outcome was, cos they, they're valuing intention far more than outcome. In fact, across adults you see very little difference between positive and negative outcome across all states because they're really judging only based on the intention of the individual, right? If, however, you compare it with kindergartners, right, our little kindergartners over here, um. When there was a positive outcome, so when Ashira was happy, their rating team is very, very nice. However, when there was a negative outcome when the shearer was not happy. Regardless of the fact that uh Tima thought she'd be happy, they're rating Tima as a nasty person. OK. So you can see again, they're valuing both the outcome and the intention. I mean, most of the outcome, you can see there's a difference here. So when, when it's a negative intention, they are rating TA as generally more nasty, right? So they're not ignoring that information. They're just kind of overvaluing the outcome information. So, culturally, it's a really interesting thing, right? Because that's the, that's the, um, development you see from kindergarten through to adulthood. If you think back, and it's kind of, I think it's kind of slightly gone out of favour now, but, you know, 5 years ago, maybe cancel culture was massive, a big, big thing. Is it still around? I don't know if it's still around. Um, there's a really big thing, bizarrely, it's this effectively. Cancel culture is kindergarten understanding of moral behaviour. To an extent, I don't mean that in an insulting way, in a, in a very basic way of viewing it. You're saying the outcome associated with someone's behaviour is more valuable, it's more important to rate that than the intention of the person. Now, obviously, if the intention is bad too, that's a whole different ball game, right? But it's very interesting in that you're looking at a trend that actually mirrors developmental trends as well. Right, so really, really interesting. You can do a PhD in that. OK great. Um, what is interesting though is that the outcome does actually matter in terms of actual behaviour, right? Um, so for example, here's the example I want to give you. So in terms of actual social behaviour. Um, imagine you're, imagine you can drive, all of you who don't drive, imagine you can drive, and you're reversing out of your, I know, driveway, street, or whatever, and you completely by accident, you don't see it, you run over the neigbour's cat. Right, so there's no intention of harm, no intention of harm whatsoever, right? So you're here, right, incidental, intention of harm. If you go round to your neighbour's house with said dead cat, right, and you just go, hi, um, I ran over your cat. It's dead. It was an accident. OK, they're gonna think you're weird. They're gonna think you're weird, because what you do is you say, I am so, so sorry. I'm really sorry, I didn't see it, it just ran out and I accidentally killed your cat. So you, you put in the, the guilt if you like, you put in the remorse that doesn't theoretically need to be there because it was an accident. It's just a social contract thing, right? So it's interesting how, you know, behaviour does in some ways dictate the way in which people interpret your intentions in the first place, right? It's similar to um what's the other one? I've gone blank. No, it'll come back. If it comes back, I'll, I'll let you know what that was. Um, oh, yay, I'll think about that while you do the lecture quiz, so. Find your canvas, please. And we will look at lecture quiz for this lecture. Now it's a bit of a cheeky question, which of the following best represents how a six year old understands the roles of consequences and social norms or conventions in judging the morality of acts? Right, so, um. Uh Uh, you can insert, if you like, um, motive, intention and outcome in there instead if you prefer. It's kind of the same stuff. Consequences in terms of, you know, the outcome, social norms or conventions in terms of, um. Uh, understanding the motivation, right, and judging that more. Are we ready? We are? Excellent. OK. Um, blind vote, blind vote, everybody. Well done. The question is which of the following best represents how a six year old understands the roles of consequences and social norms in judging the morality of acts? OK, A. Billy broke a cup, so he must be naughty. Billy is only naughty if he broke the cup on purpose. See, Billy tried to break the cup, but it didn't break, so he isn't naughty. Billy is only naughty if he broke the cup by accident. Billy is naughty for breaking the cup, more so because he did it on purpose. And hands down. OK. Well done everybody, that was a hard one. It is this one, I mean, when it says best represents, this is often what multiple choice questions are like in exams, right? And they're horrible because it's best represents rather than this won't be in your exam, by the way, this none of the questions in the quiz will be in your exam, um. It's, it's uh tricky because some of the answers are would do, right, some of the answers kind of semi fit. So you could argue that Billy broke a cup, so he must be naughty, right, there's an element of that in there, the outcome is valued more. Um, they also value intention. You could, you could might vote for that one. The one that's most accurate is this one because it balances out the favouring of outcome, but also valuing the intention as well. Oh, sorry, so put in E. Put E in in your canvas. OK. Oh, so, um, this is from earlier, right, so. Children do balance the motive of other people's behaviour and that when they judge whether someone's a nice or nasty person. They do show some capacity to associate the actor's intentions with his or her traits, i, you know, how good a person he is. However, what we just saw just then is that their performance is, it does differ from adults. They do outweigh the outcome. So we'll come back to this understanding of people as nice or nasty um in a minute. But first, this question, can we use emotion attributions to directly assess children's moral thinking? So this is something called the Happy Victimizer task. It's, again, it's a very neat little task. It's called the Happy Victimizer task. So this is what happens, right? Your children are asked this. They're shown these little kind of, uh, vignette scenarios in this order. So here, we'll call this Bob, and that's Jerry. Um, so Bob and Jerry are friends, right? And this is, um, at school, right, in the kind of locker room at school, in the changing area at school. And, uh, Jerry is showing Bobby he's got some lollies. And then he puts them in his little, little bag there, or his coat, I think. um, and then Jerry goes away, so he goes to the toilet. Or somewhere else. Then Bob takes the lollies, right, it's a stealing scenario. And then when Jerry comes out, you can see that he's sad because his lollies have gone. OK. So it's a, it's a very simple scenario. One boy has stolen the lollies, the other boys upset about it. Here's what's really interesting. If you ask a 4 year old and an eight year old, the question, is it wrong to steal? They will say yes. Right, they know that. Right, as we saw, 2.5 year olds, even younger can um identify a moral, the breaking of a moral prescription versus a social convention. They know this is serious. If you ask them how do you feel when you steal something you want, or in that scenario, for example, how does Bob feel when you steal something you want, a 4 year old will say good. The 8 year old by that point will say, oh, you know, you'll feel bad, you'll feel guilty, you're ashamed, right, that's the answer you expect, that's the answer you expect an adult to give, because there's some kind of emotionally binding, uh, Tie, right, between um breaking a moral convention, a prescription, breaking, doing a morally wrong behaviour, and feeling a negative emotion, right, feeling shame, feeling guilt. So this answer is really interesting. In some ways they're more honest. Right? Human behaviour is driven by motivation. Right? Now, You don't do anything. What that means is you don't do anything unless you want to do it. So if you steal someone's lollies, if you steal something that you wanted, you feel good. You do, otherwise you wouldn't have done it. That's the motivation. And you might only feel good for, you know, a second or you might only feel part partly good and the rest of you feels really bad. But they are accurate in that. If they didn't feel good doing it, they would not have done that behaviour. You can't get humans to do things that they do not effectively want to do. But they're not kind of given the correct answer. They're not recognising that doing something that they've already told you is wrong, morally wrong, should induce this kind of guilty or ashamed feeling. So the happy victimizer task is kind of a benchmark task really, because it appears to show that despite their awareness of moral rules, so despite that awareness, 4 year olds do not understand the emotionally binding nature of moral rules, whereas eight year olds do. So what's happening between those ages? Well, what's quite interesting is that, um, when children between 5 and 7 years of age, are between those two, age boundaries, if they're first directed to the transgressor's wish, right? If they're first, um, kind of told, you know, Bob really wants those lollies. He really wants to steal those lollies, they're more likely to, um, Say that they transgressor feels good, right? They're more likely to give the happy victimizer answer, which is that they feel good rather than bad. However, if you first ask them about the moral evaluation, so if you first say, Is it OK, so you put that question in first that we saw before, Is it wrong to steal? They'll say yes, then they're more likely to make, um, the appropriate emotional attribution and say they feel bad. OK. So you can kind of prime them effectively. You can kind of shift, shuffshift, shift, shuffle them around within those answers, depending on how you prime them. OK. Oh, a little aside, um, I don't think this book really exists here, but it was big in, like, I'm gonna say the early 90s, late 80s in the UK. So these authors are really great. They're great books if you've got kids. They're really great. But this book called Burglar Bill is kind of aimed at that age range. It's kind of 3 to 7, say. And I do remember a bit of a hoo-ha in the UK a few years back when they said it should be banned, right? This book should not be allowed for children, because it's talking about a burglar. Right? And it's kind of, you know, the burglar's quite a nice guy. He's a burglar bill. He's quite nice. He goes around stealing stuff. He eventually accidentally steals a baby. The baby belongs to a, a lady burglar, right? And yay, they get married. Um, and they, they get married, and they decide that they, uh, they don't like stealing anymore, because she says, you know, I was very, very upset when I lost my baby. Um, he says, I've done a really bad thing. She said, I've done a really bad thing. And they give all things back, and they sell all, give all the money that they've made back to the police benevolent fund. It's great. Um, what's really funny though, is that, like, it's perfect. It's perfect for that age group, right? The reason it's perfect, it's not vilifying, right? It's not saying that Burglar Billard's a bad person, but it's showing kids that, you know, he did something wrong, morally wrong, and then recognised that he did something morally wrong and then changed his behaviour. Right? It's a, it's a very, I don't see any. There's kind of no issue if you understand that kids actually are able to understand people's intentions and outcomes. As an aside, um, the other thing I think is really sweet is this, um, sweet if you've got a 4 or 5 year old, um. So children's um. Adults, for example, can make predictions of other people's behaviour based on effectively what they view their personality to be. All right, so if you have a friend, for example, that's, you know, socially anxious or very shy, whichever one you want to call, personality, um, you might, you might have experienced asking them to come to a party and they say no. So you probably expect them maybe to say no next time. Right, no judgement there, but that's what we expect based on their kind of behaved personality. You say they're shy, they don't like parties, they. So that only happens at a certain stage of development. So the process of making behaviour to behaviour inferences, which is based on personality, um, before that point can be decomposed into two components. So a behaviour to trait inference and a trait to behaviour prediction. So at 4 to 5 years of age, kids do those things separately. So for example, if a 4 or 5 year old is at preschool. And one day, Bobby does not share the cookies with him. That 4 or 5 year old might think Bobby is selfish. But that doesn't extend kind of to the next day. So, what's really sweet about it is that the next day, there's no enduring understanding that Bobby is selfish. Right? So the next day, you know, Bobby might, might share his pencils with him, and the outcome will be like, Oh, Bobby's not selfish. That's great. But what they will do is this, so if they have the idea that Bobby is selfish, right? They might then predict behaviour from that, OK? So they might say selfish, he's not gonna do that, he's not gonna share his toys with me. OK, so it's it's much more flexible if, if, if you like, because they're separate. Whereas by the time you get to 7 or 8, those processes are together and you get this. Bobby does not share cookies with his classmates, and Bobby does not let others play with his toy because he is selfish. So that kind of personality trait, if you like, by the time kids are 7 or 8 has become quite fixed, right? They're making a judgement about a person based on their experience of their behaviour, so it's a fair judgement. But it's more enduring. And say a 4 or 5 year old who's more flexible with their um judgments, yeah. Say that, sorry? I don't think it's just memory, I think it's, it's just the way in which they, you know, understand behaviour. I think, really, you know, I think you gotta have a certain um. Cause a certain understanding that people are stable, that people differ in kind of clear basic ways. Um, I think everything's so kind of fluctuated when you're 4 or 5 that you may not have that, you know, capacity, I think. It's OK. Um, So yeah in some ways it's, it's, you know, it's quite sweet, but also think about this, what age do kids start school, right? If you've got a kid with behaviour problems in kindy, so we'll say 564, 56, um, they've probably got until year 1. Year 2 maximum before all the other kids in their class have made up their mind about them. Now, that's really problematic. If you've got a kid who's got behavioural challenges, um, whatever, whatever they may be, that aren't being addressed, it's very hard to then change people's, you know, assumptions of who you are and how you behave. That's why in early intervention, it's very important. So, summary so far. Young children as young as 4 or 5 are attuned to intentions and motives. However, they do not privilege intention and motive as much as their older counterparts. OK? Um, So they, in other words, they're overvaluing outcome. They understand that the actor in the happy victimizer scenario is a bad person, motivated by bad intentions, but they don't balance that awareness with the emotional connection of that, right? They don't kind of connect. Uh, the judgement of that person with how you should emotionally feel concerning that. Nevertheless, from about 5, children are starting to make enduring assumptions about people's character on the basis of their actions, probably 6 sessions. They're starting to, by 7 or 8, they are, they're starting to. OK, so Children, we know that children are able to identify the moral domain very early, right, we saw that they're able to make a distinction between social conventions and moral prescriptions at 2.5. Right, so very, very early and that doesn't develop, right, that's pretty stable. We've seen that the happy vote to victimizer task allows this distinction to be made between children who attribute moral emotions and those who don't, right? But what does that imply? Why is that useful? And we've seen the strong arguments have been put forward for the emotional basis of morality, but that doesn't seem to be enough of a story, right? We need to know about children's capacity to judge the person's intention as good or bad, right? In other words, you can imagine a scenario where, you know, and this happens at, you know, schools, kids have different personalities. One child could be doing absolutely nothing wrong, right? They could just be playing, another child will just start crying cause they're upset that the game's not going their way. Right, the kids are upset, they haven't had a chance to kick the football, they're not very good at football, that's the only reason they haven't got it, and they cry and they get upset and they get angry at the other kid, right? If another kid kid comes in and just goes, oh that person's upset, and you see this, you see this in schools with, you know, some teachers do this, the child that's upset. Can't be believed on the basis that they're upset. OK? I don't mean that in a, in a judgmental way, right? But kids are very different in the way they express emotions. So if you've got two kids in an argument, you can't go, Well, that one's crying. Therefore, they're the one that's the worst things happen to. The other one might just be not a crier. It doesn't mean that they're less upset. Um, which is why it's, I mean, I'm not a teacher, like, I'm not a school teacher. I'm sure it's a very, very, very hard job, um, because you've got to think about all that stuff, like, balance, all that stuff. And obviously knowing the kids that you're teaching is very valuable. Um We've also seen that even very young children are sensitive to people's intentions, although they don't seem to put the same emphasis on motives and intentions as older children and adults. But what we're gonna look more at is this one, is there more to be learned from the happy victimizer? Aradi. Yes, there is. Um, the reason it's such a clever task is that it actually balances the child's understanding of the events and the motives, which are kind of cognitive, right? So, do they understand that Bobby wants the lollies, right, and their intention is to steal them. And it balances that with an emotional aspect, which is that the other person, 22 emotional aspects, one that the other person in the story is upset or angry, or whatever that emotion might be. But also with their own understanding of how it should feel. Right, how it should feel when you do something that is um against moral prescriptions. We do actually know that there's a consistent relationship between the moral emotion attribution on this task and social outcomes. So children and adults, but children who make more or become stronger moral emotions, which actually means less of the happy victimizer phenomenon. They're more likely to say that the person feels bad, right? tend to be more prosocial and less anti-social in terms of actual behaviour, typically reported by a teacher. Those who do the opposite, so those who have weaker moral emotions, those who say, oh he feels good, he's got what he wanted, less prosocial and more anti-social. Um, and this is from a meta-analysis, huge meta-analysis, 42 studies with over 8000 participants. There's a moderately strong relationship between moral emotion attribution and anti-social behaviour. So we're kind of coming full circle back to the idea of anti-social behaviour. Psychopathy, if that's relevant. Um, so the more moral children, the ones that had fewer happy victimizer responses showed less antisocial behaviour. Anti-social behaviour is not the opposite of prosocial behaviour. They're distinct things, they're not the flip side of the same coin, which potentially is why the relationship was weaker between moral emotion attribution and prosocial behaviour. OK, so the children that showed less happy victimizer responses also showed more prosocial behaviour. In other words, what the kind of conclusion here is that for some people, um. Who are maybe more likely to engage in antisocial behaviour, have a moral self-concept, um, in which they do not find the consequences of moral transgressions to be very personally, emotionally binding. So you can see how Blair and Darwin and other people are saying kind of similar things. It's not the same argument exactly, but they're kind of saying similar things, which is that they, there's something to do with engaging in antisocial behaviour. Which means that the connectedness between kind of your own behaviour, doing things that you know are wrong. Is not as closely associated or attached to emotional response as it should be. OK, well it is other people. I can't necessarily say as it should be, but in terms of other people. Hang on. Interesting one with this one before I'm, how am I doing? Oh, good. Um, interesting one with this one. If you think back to, like, I was talking to someone the other week about, you know, trolley problems, the classic trolley problem, with, you know, pulling the lever. And it's interesting because when you talk about that problem, so the classic one is that a trolley that's running down the track, um, and it's about to run over, um, normally like 3 people, I think normally gonna run over 3 people. And you have the option of pulling a lever, so it runs onto a track with only 1 person. Right, so it's like, do you make the choice to save 3 people or sacrifice one? That's interesting because most people, um, well are obviously, it's not ecologically particularly valid. Um, but most people will answer that they would, um. Not pull the lever. Right? Because there's a kind of um ownership or there's a kind of a decision that someone has made to do that. So it's, it's um. Kind of an emotional response to go. You know, I can't, I can't do that to that one person, it's not my choice, it's been set up, you know. The other option, the other answer is, um, far more kind of rational or cognitive, which goes, well, it's 3 versus 1. You know, I'm gonna kill one, save 3, easy, not easy, but that's, you know, that's the answer. In some ways it's really interesting because I think there's a kind of general assumption that the emotional one is the correct one. But the emotional response to go, you know, I can't do anything that would potentially cause harm to somebody else is the correct response. There is no correct response. Right, they both have positive and negatives to them and you find a similar thing in this kind of argument. I think, right? There's, it's not correct. There's no kind of correct version where the more emotionally binding something, the better it is. Because the less emotionally binding, you find something, the more likely you are, for example, to make that kind of rational decision. So it's almost like a rationality versus sentimentalist division as well. OK? Don't get caught in the trap of thinking that there's a kind of normal or correct, and anything else is bad or, you know, atypical or psychopathological. It could be related to those things, but there's also often other reasons why it's um. Just a variation, like people vary. That is the end of that one, by the way, at the end of this lecture, I put some of the slides from Darwin. It's because I had them in there already, um, there's no point reading them out, but if you want to read how he talks about this issue, then they're just there at the end, OK? Excellent, do you want to take a 10 minute break? Yeah, come back, bang on 2.

SPEAKER 1
But you can have a look at those all the way up, OK. He Yeah. Um. Yeah. And OK Yeah Yeah I Yes. Yeah Mhm OK. I It. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah Oh Yeah I No. Sure, is this um is this area of, um, you

SPEAKER 2
know, moral development something you'd potentially supervise on in honours is?

SPEAKER 1
OK. OK As opposed to what then?

SPEAKER 2
OK, that's fine, yeah, I don't, yeah, it's not it's not the development part that I'm interested in as much as the moral.

SPEAKER 1
Oh.

SPEAKER 2
Oh, cool, for adults.

SPEAKER 1
Oh interesting. Yeah Was what?

SPEAKER 2
Clinic kids. What's that mean?

SPEAKER 0
OK.

SPEAKER 1
I OK. Yeah. Yeah. You I have. OK. Mhm. OK. I I try out on adults who who've got the

SPEAKER 2
ability to consent is good.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. Do do experiments all tend to be, uh, I mean,

SPEAKER 2
the, the ones that the what I would call sexy experiments, the ones I get excited about, the ones where there's actually like a room, there's people in it, and there's stuff going on. Does that actually happened or is it all like, I'm, you know, typing on it? OK.

SPEAKER 1
Right. OK.

SPEAKER 2
Had to have people, yeah.

SPEAKER 1
OK. Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
It's not it's not beyond the scope of a year.

SPEAKER 0
Honestly it is.

SPEAKER 1
For what? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, I, I, it's, it's, it's from the start, it's always been an exciting prospect for me to do that year. I just hope I'm not having to like massively down, downgrade my expectations about what I might be able to do. I probably will, but just the idea that someone says like, no, you can never put people in a room and, you know, yeah, that's just too much.

SPEAKER 1
OK.

SPEAKER 2
As potential supervisors. I only know about 3, where am I where am I supposed to find them?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER 2
What they do, and that's a matter of like looking at your pages and saying. Yes.

SPEAKER 1
Right. OK. Um, I feel like if I'm not, if, if, if

SPEAKER 2
the outcome's not important to me, I'm not, the work's not gonna get done, you know, I'm not gonna put myself into it and put the work in. I need to be motivated. I mean, it's hard getting through these 3 years when it's, you're so sort of prescribed about what you're gonna do, I'm jumping through hoops and everything, you know, looking forward to having a, a little bit of creativity, yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
Well, you're somewhere in the top 30 already, I can tell you that. I, I guarantee you're in the top 30 at the moment.

SPEAKER 1
Oh yeah. 331. Um Hang on, hang on.

SPEAKER 0
Was that what it was on before? Oh, it's very weird when it goes to. Really, was it on that? Is that OK, everybody? Yes, yes. You see? OK, good. Hang on. It would help if I put some slides up, hold on.

SPEAKER 1
OK. Yeah Yeah I Alright, if you're still coming in, if
