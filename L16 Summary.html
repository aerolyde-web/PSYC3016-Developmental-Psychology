        <div class="summary-text">
            The <span class="nativist">nativism-constructivism debate</span> in infant cognition fundamentally concerns the <span class="key-concept">architecture of learning mechanisms</span>: whether infants possess innate <span class="nativist">domain-specific modules</span> containing <span class="key-concept">core knowledge</span> about objects, agents, and number that are triggered by specific perceptual inputs (the nativist position of Carey, Spelke, and Baillargeon), or whether all knowledge emerges through <span class="constructivist">domain-general information processing</span> that detects low-level features and hierarchically constructs higher-order representations through experience (the constructivist position of Cohen and Cashon). This is not a simple "nature versus nurture" debate—both camps acknowledge roles for genetics and learning—but rather a dispute about whether learning mechanisms are <span class="nativist">specialized for specific content domains</span> or apply <span class="constructivist">the same statistical learning processes to all inputs</span>. The critical evidence battleground centers on <span class="key-concept">object unity and permanence</span>: <span class="evidence">Kellman and Spelke (1983)</span> demonstrated that 4-month-olds perceive a rod moving behind an occluder as a unified object when its visible portions exhibit <span class="key-concept">common motion</span> (coordinated movement), looking longer at a broken rod at test—a pattern nativists interpret as the <span class="nativist">object module being triggered by common motion</span> to apply innate principles about object boundaries, while constructivists argue infants are <span class="constructivist">gradually learning statistical regularities</span> (surfaces that move together tend to be parts of the same object) as evidenced by <span class="evidence">Johnson and Aslin's (1998)</span> finding that younger infants require more visible surface to demonstrate unity. <span class="evidence">Baillargeon's violation-of-expectation paradigms</span>—including the classic <span class="method">drawbridge study</span> where 4.5-month-olds look longer when a drawbridge appears to rotate through a hidden box, and <span class="method">car studies</span> where infants are surprised when objects pass through solid obstacles—provide the strongest nativist evidence, with <span class="nativist">longer looking to perceptually familiar but physically impossible events</span> interpreted as conceptual surprise when core knowledge expectations (solidity, continuity) are violated. However, <span class="critique">Cohen and Cashon's methodological critique</span> challenges this interpretation by noting that <span class="critique">Baillargeon included infants who did not fully habituate</span> (less than 50% looking time reduction), and according to <span class="evidence">Hunter and Ames (1988)</span>, incompletely habituated infants show <span class="critique">familiarity preferences</span> rather than novelty preferences—meaning longer looking to the impossible event (which is perceptually familiar and often contains more motion) could reflect perceptual preference rather than physics knowledge. The <span class="method">reaching-versus-looking-time dissociation</span> further complicates interpretation: while infants succeed on <span class="method">violation-of-expectation looking-time tasks</span> at 3.5-4.5 months, they fail <span class="method">Piagetian manual search tasks</span> until 8-9 months, which nativists attribute to <span class="nativist">performance limitations</span> (motor planning, inhibitory control) masking underlying competence, while constructivists argue that <span class="constructivist">looking time measures shallow perceptual expectations</span> whereas reaching measures true conceptual permanence. The decisive evidence comes from <span class="evidence">Meltzoff and Moore's (1998) dissociation studies</span>: 5-month-olds show surprise when an object's features change across occlusion (detecting shape mismatches) but do <em>not</em> show surprise when an object disappears behind one screen and emerges from behind another without appearing in the gap between them (spatial discontinuity), whereas 9-month-olds show both—suggesting that <span class="constructivist">memory for object features precedes understanding of spatiotemporal continuity</span>, supporting Piaget's constructivist timeline and refuting the nativist claim of unified early object permanence. The interpretive pivot that students most commonly mishandle is <span class="key-concept">conflating early behavioral competence with innateness</span>: nativists argue that failure at younger ages reflects <span class="nativist">performance limitations in perceptual or motor systems</span> rather than absence of knowledge (competence-performance gap), while constructivists counter that <span class="constructivist">rapid learning from billions of perceptual experiences in the first months</span> can produce sophisticated behaviors without innate knowledge, and point to <span class="evidence">gradual developmental trajectories</span> (2-month-olds needing small occluders, 4-month-olds succeeding with large occluders) as signatures of incremental construction rather than sudden module activation. Ultimately, the debate remains unresolved because both frameworks can accommodate most findings by adjusting auxiliary assumptions: nativists locate developmental change in the maturation of <span class="nativist">perceptual input systems that feed innate modules</span>, while constructivists locate it in the <span class="constructivist">gradual hierarchical construction of representations themselves</span>—the frameworks differ not in whether development occurs, but in <em>where</em> the locus of development resides (input systems versus knowledge structures).
