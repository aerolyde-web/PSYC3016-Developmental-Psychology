            <span class="key-concept">Abstract relational thinking</span>—recognizing that two pairs of identical objects share the relation "same" despite having no perceptual features in common—represents a uniquely human cognitive achievement nearly impossible for non-human animals even after extensive training, raising the fundamental developmental question of whether infants possess <span class="nativist">innate domain-specific modules triggered by perceptual input</span> (the nativist position) or whether <span class="constructivist">higher-level relational representations emerge hierarchically from lower-level featural information through domain-general learning mechanisms</span> (the neoconstructivist position). <span class="evidence">Gentner's (1982) Natural Partitions Hypothesis</span> establishes the theoretical foundation by proposing that human cognition parses the world into <span class="key-concept">objects</span> (entities with stable perceptual cohesion, clear figure-ground contrast, temporal persistence) and <span class="key-concept">relations</span> (connections between objects that are dynamic, unstable, and harder to perceive directly), with objects being cognitively privileged because they map onto stable perceptual input whereas relations are context-dependent and require abstracting patterns across multiple object instances, making <span class="mechanism">relational learning computationally more demanding than object recognition</span>. The experimental logic for testing relational abstraction exploits <span class="mechanism">familiarization-test paradigms with the generalization criterion</span>: after habituation to multiple exemplar pairs all instantiating the same relation (e.g., two goldfish, two crocodiles = "same"), infants are tested with novel objects in the familiar relation (two elephants) versus novel relation (elephant and giraffe), and if infants show a <span class="finding">novelty preference for the novel relation but not the novel objects in the familiar relation</span>, they have abstracted the relation independently of object identity. <span class="evidence">Ferry, Hespos & Gentner (2015)</span> demonstrated that 7-9 month olds successfully abstract same/different relations with 4 diverse exemplar pairs but <span class="finding">fail with a single repeated pair</span> (infants encode "goldfish-ness" rather than "sameness") and, most diagnostically, <span class="finding">fail when objects were played with in the waiting room but not habituated during familiarization</span> (the <span class="key-concept">object experience effect</span>), revealing that <span class="mechanism">mere familiarity without habituation-based encoding increases object salience, consuming cognitive resources and preventing relational processing</span>—the infant system prioritizes lower-level object representation when objects are unexpectedly re-encountered, blocking access to higher-level relational representation. <span class="evidence">Anderson et al. (2018)</span> pushed the developmental boundary to 3 months, demonstrating successful same/different abstraction with 2 exemplar pairs but <span class="finding">failure with 6 pairs due to cognitive overload</span>, establishing that <span class="mechanism">relational capacity exists remarkably early but is highly sensitive to task demands</span>, with the number of exemplar pairs following a Goldilocks principle: too few prevents abstraction (infants remember specific objects), too many exceeds capacity (infants revert to featural encoding), and just right (2-4 pairs depending on age and complexity) enables relational generalization. The <span class="key-concept">causal perception</span> literature provides converging evidence for the <span class="constructivist">hierarchical construction framework</span>: <span class="evidence">Leslie (1984)</span> argued for <span class="nativist">nativism by demonstrating that 6-month-olds habituated to direct launching (moving object A contacts stationary object B, which immediately moves) dishabituate to delayed reaction (non-causal)</span> and those habituated to one non-causal event generalize to a different non-causal event, suggesting they categorize events as causal versus non-causal rather than encoding specific spatiotemporal features, interpreted as evidence that <span class="nativist">specific spatiotemporal patterns trigger an innate causal perception module</span>. However, <span class="evidence">Oakes & Cohen (1990) and Cohen & Oakes (1993)</span> challenged this interpretation through systematic manipulation of <span class="mechanism">object complexity and object variability</span>: when <span class="evidence">Leslie used simple geometric shapes that varied minimally trial-to-trial</span>, 6-month-olds showed causal categorization, but when <span class="evidence">Oakes & Cohen used complex realistic toys (dinosaurs, airplanes) that remained constant</span>, <span class="finding">6-month-olds reverted to featural processing (looking equally at familiar and novel events) while 10-month-olds showed Leslie's causal pattern</span>, and most strikingly, when <span class="evidence">complex objects varied on every trial (different toys in each event)</span>, <span class="finding">even 10-month-olds reverted to featural processing</span>, demonstrating <span class="mechanism">cognitive overload: when object variability demands cognitive resources, relational (causal) processing becomes unavailable, and infants revert to lower-level feature processing</span>—exactly as <span class="constructivist">neoconstructivism predicts but modularity cannot explain</span>. The <span class="key-concept">signature behavioral pattern of neoconstructivism</span> is that <span class="constructivist">increasing cognitive load lowers information processing level</span>: the same infant at the same age succeeds with low-load stimuli (simple shapes, repeated objects, 2-4 exemplar pairs) but fails with high-load stimuli (complex toys, varying objects, 6+ exemplar pairs), even though the relational structure is held constant, revealing that <span class="mechanism">causal perception and relational abstraction are higher-level representations built hierarchically on object representations</span>—when object processing is simple and automatic, cognitive resources remain available for causal abstraction, but when object complexity or variability increases, younger infants lack capacity while older infants succeed until variability further increases and even older infants are overwhelmed. The theoretical adjudication between frameworks hinges on <span class="key-concept">task-dependent variability</span>: <span class="nativist">nativism proposes that domain-specific modules should function relatively consistently once triggering input is present, regardless of lower-level stimulus details</span>, predicting that if spatiotemporal causal patterns are present, 6-month-olds should show causal perception with simple or complex objects, and if same/different structure is present, infants should abstract relations regardless of object salience, whereas <span class="constructivist">neoconstructivism proposes that higher-level units are formed from relationships among lower-level units through hierarchical learning, with infants tending to use the highest-level units available but reverting to lower-level processing when the system gets overloaded</span>, predicting graded, load-dependent performance where success systematically degrades with increased cognitive load. The critical empirical evidence favoring <span class="constructivist">constructivism</span> comes from systematic patterns across both domains: <span class="evidence">Leslie (1984)</span> found causal perception in 6-month-olds with simple shapes; <span class="evidence">Oakes & Cohen (1990)</span> found failure in 6-month-olds with complex objects but success in 10-month-olds with the same complex objects; <span class="evidence">Cohen & Oakes (1993)</span> found failure in 10-month-olds when object variability increased; <span class="evidence">Ferry et al. (2015)</span> found same/different learning in 7-9 month olds with 4 pairs but failure with 1 pair or with salient un-habituated objects; <span class="evidence">Anderson et al. (2018)</span> found success in 3-month-olds with 2 pairs but failure with 6 pairs—these graded, load-dependent patterns cannot be explained by all-or-nothing module maturation but are naturally explained by <span class="mechanism">hierarchical construction where relational representations depend on available capacity after lower-level processing</span>, and capacity is both age-dependent (older infants have more) and load-sensitive (complex stimuli consume more). The unifying principle resolves the nativism-constructivism debate by demonstrating that <span class="finding">relational cognition is not an innate module but an emergent property of a hierarchical learning system</span>, where <span class="constructivist">domain-general information processing mechanisms detect low-level features, construct higher-level units from relationships among lower-level units, and access relational representations only when sufficient processing capacity remains after object-level encoding is complete</span>, explaining why the same infant can demonstrate sophisticated relational abstraction under optimal conditions yet fail completely when cognitive load exceeds developmental capacity—a pattern that challenges <span class="nativist">nativism's core assumption that domain-specific modules fire consistently when triggered</span> and supports <span class="constructivist">constructivism's prediction that cognitive architecture is hierarchical, capacity-limited, and dynamically sensitive to task demands rather than modular, domain-specific, and capacity-independent</span>.
