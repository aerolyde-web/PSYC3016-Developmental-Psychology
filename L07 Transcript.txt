OK, if you're still, if you're still coming in, can you try and make it to a seat as fast as possible, please? Can everyone shuffle to either the middle or the edges, please? OK, thank you. Um, if people come in, for those of you sitting on the edges of the middle row. People sitting on the edges of the middle row, you may need to shuffle in, OK? There are seats around, but just um. Just be aware that you might need to shuffle.

SPEAKER 1
Uh I People, I am waiting to start.

Thank you. OK, um. Today we have the last lecture from the social cognition miniseries, and we have the first lecture from the moral uh development series as well. So there'll be, there'll be, there, there are relatedness between them, but they're different mini topics, OK? This lecture here, this 3rd 1 from a social cognition stream, is, um, it does, I'm gonna warn you ahead of time, it does jump around a bit. OK? At the end, it should all come together, but it jumps around from kind of topic to topic slightly in this lecture. OK? So, don't worry about that. If you feel like you're not following right now, do not worry. When you come back to look at it, um, just go through it slowly, OK? OK, so, um, these are learning outcomes from the whole unit that I won't go over again. So here's a question, you might recognise that face potentially from 1st year and or 2nd year. Um, and it is Trevartham who kind of was interested in this idea of innate infant intersubjectivity. So this might be familiar from 1st and 2nd year. Basically, when we talk about that dance of communication between, um, an infant and their caregiver. It's talking about this intersubjectivity, OK, so this kind of understanding that there are two. Subjects and they can understand one another. OK, you might remember from the last lecture. We talked about something else which we call triadic um interactions. Which as far as Trevarthan was concerned, he put it into that category of secondary intersubjectivity. OK, so innate infant intersubjectivity is that dyadic interaction with two subjects people person. Um, secondary is what we talk about when we think about triadic interactions, right? So the idea you've got another thing. Included um in that interaction, OK, so for example the incorporation of objects. It can be other people, it can be, you know, an animal, but um typically it's an object into the interaction. So, um, from the kind of animal research perspective, so the chimpanzee research, Thomas Sloan, carpenter. Talked about an idea called shared intentionality. OK, and they were interested in this idea because they thought it was something that kind of differed between humans and um the ape species. So Thomasello said that human cognition seems very different from chimpanzee cognition, um, kind of not so much on the basis on the individual brain power, but kind of alongside this we got skin idea is that what makes human cognition different, um, is rather the ability of humans to collaborate with each other in collective activities, right? So hopefully you can see the relationships here between the different ideas. So that triadic interaction, um, That kind of interactivity involving another object, that's required in order to form collaboration. Right? I'll give you some examples, hopefully it'll make sense. So Thomas Seller said that shared intentionality. Is one possibility is the mechanism to explain the cultural achievement effectively of collaborations, the differences between humans and chimpanzees. So secondary intersubjectivity, shared intentionality, triadic interactions, we're all kind of talking about the same thing just in kind of slightly different contexts. OK? So here are 3, it says 4, there are 3 domains, um. Which you see in chimpanzees, but then the arrow, so here is what happens when you get shared intentionality. So gaze following, so chimpanzees will follow the kind of head direction of another chimpanzee. That's different from joint attention, so when you add that shared intentionality or the shared attentional framework, it becomes a joint attention. Right? Two things looking at one thing or attending to one thing versus one chimpanzee looking at what another one is doing. OK, and then maybe looking at the same thing. It's different. A group activity. For example, if chimpanzees are all in the trees and they're picking berries, each individual chimpanzee is picking berries, right? It's totally functional. It works. They're each picking berries to feed themselves. Collaboration is something different. Collaboration is when you have that joint kind of framework of what everyone is doing. We are collaboratively picking berries. Now, some of them might be, some humans, this is might be shaking the tree. Have you seen those machines that do that? And it's a massive like metal pincer, and they just actually vibrate through. It's amazing. Um, not that. The idea is that each one, each person might have a different job. OK, only some of those people might be actually picking berries, some might be picking them up off the floor, some might be holding buckets, some might be shaking the tree, right? That's a collaboration versus a group activity. And then social learning is, is kind of passive, right? It's when you're watching, it's when you're observing and learning from the behaviour of others versus instructed learning. In order for instructed learning to work, there has to be that kind of shared framework or cognitive framework of this is what's happening right now. OK? There is a shared attentional frame right now in that if we didn't have that frame, Why on earth would you always sitting there listening to me, right? You're wondering why you'd be sitting because you come in and see what's going on and walk out again, maybe come up here, do some talking. OK, it has to be a shared attentional framework. Um So with this example, like gays following becomes joint attention, um, in this kind of concept of shared intentionality, um. As we've said, chimpanzees can do this, so apes can follow the gaze of a human. So they can understand the kind of point, right, so basically instruction, information. What they don't grasp is that partners and communication share a joint attentional frame or a common ground. OK, I'll give you a really good example of this. In a game of hide and seek, you'd be playing with a young child, 1415, 16 months, whatever. Um, they understand if you're playing a game and you've been, you know, playing it for a while, they understand that if you're playing a game where you're, you're hiding an object, right? And they need to find it, that if I point to the bucket. But it means I'm kind of communicating something inside. Cos that's the game we've been playing. Yeah, um. A chimpanzee won't do that. So a chimpanzee will not join in with that attentional frame, they'll look at the bucket and say, OK, it's a bucket, that's not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for the food. So that's quite a nice example to keep in your mind about what it looks like to be in a shared attentional frame. OK, it's kind of like unspoken communication that you just know is there. This is the first bit where it jumps around, right? So what I'm trying to do there is. This is social cognition, right, so on a social scale, and we're looking at groups, this is where something like those triadic interactions becomes important in terms of group function. Yeah, the difference between humans and chimpanzees, one of them, not necessarily the most important one, but one of them might be the ability to use this shared attention or frame, these kind of triic interactions. I'm gonna jump now to just do a little slide on some distinctions that we're making in this course that are quite important. So one of the distinctions that we're making, which will come up again in this lecture, is that of belief versus ignorance. So when you think about, um, those tasks with the chimpanzees, right, where there's hidden fruit in the buckets, yeah? And we saw last lecture that there's a difference between human infants and chimpanzees and what they can do in that it seems like at least in the experiments that we've done so far. It seems that while Children can um kind of hold on to the um false belief state of another person, right? Those kind of looking time experiments. Children aged 4 can pass an explicit false belief task. Chimpanzees cannot, right? So they understand when another chimp is, is uninformed. They can do that. They know when another chimp knows something is there, but they don't know if it's there. They seem to have a kind of difficulty, potentially with just with the cognitive load of holding in their mind the reality of the situation at the same time as what the chimpanzee, other chimpanzee believes to be true. OK, so belief versus ignorance, what does the other chimpanzee or other object, the other person believe to be true. Versus what do they know versus not know, OK? Belief or misbelief is different from just not knowing. The one we just looked at briefly there is coordination versus collaboration. So coordination is not the same thing as everyone doing the same thing at the same time, collaboration is when you've got that shared attentional frame. And that seems to be linked to the ability to engage in triadic interactions with another person, right, to share a kind of mental state. The final one Which we'll look at a bit more now, it's implicit versus explicit theory of mind. OK? Now implicit and explicit, those terms mean different things in different parts of psychology. OK, so it gets a bit confusing. um. I guess what we're meaning here is explicit is a measure of theory of mind where the child has to kind of do something or say something to demonstrate that they have that knowledge, right? So they, if it's a verbal theory of mind task, they need to say, oh, they think the apple's in the bucket or something, right? Um, or they might need to select the right answer or if it's on the computer. Implicit would be typically what we look at things like eye gaze. So we're not asking anyone to give an answer to articulate an answer, we're just looking at what their kind of attentional systems, for example, are doing. OK. So back to one last little slide of all the things we've been through so far, we're up to the very last one. False belief, understanding. And we need to look at what is involved in false belief understanding before we get into the nitty gritty. So, ooh, hang on. See, I told we jumped around. We're gonna get this over and done with now. Lecture quiz. If you find your canvas page, we will do the lecture quiz. There is another one in the next lecture, but don't do that on canvas. Do this one on Canvas, OK? Cause I put in the answer based on this one. OK, do you all have canvas ready? And I'm gonna say it again just in case people haven't been able to attend the first few lectures, do not put in the answer until I've told you the answer. OK? Are we ready? No, yes. Oh, yes. Yes, we've got thumbs up, like the thumbs up. Yes, yay. See your thumbs up. OK. Here we go. Um, OK, blind vote first. If you wanna shut your eyes, um. Here we go, which of the following do apes seem incapable of doing? Is it A, keeping track of what another has just seen? Is it B, understanding the intentions of others? Is it C, self recognition? Is it D keeping track of another's mental state at the same time as their own? Or is it E affective empathy? OK, open your eyes. The answer is D, OK? For those of you who weren't sure, this one, remember, understanding the intentions of others or goals of of others, that was demonstrated with the experiment where they had the, they saw the guy holding the bucket or not holding the bucket. Right, do you remember that one? Um, and the chimpanzees behaved according to whether the, um, man had a bucket in his hands or didn't have a bucket in his hands, OK? If he had a bucket in his hands, they assumed his intention was to turn on the bucket and they used their own hand. If you didn't have a bucket, they used their foot, OK? OK, well done everybody, so put in D. Your answer is D. OK, so, false belief understanding. What is involved, so. Have you seen these diagrams before? I can never remember if I put them in the 2nd year or not. Well they, hang on, which do you know, it's fine. Um, you had me last, hang on, wait. Which semester are we in 2nd semester? That's fine. I was on sabbatical last semester, so I didn't teach 2nd year, and I was trying to work out if that was you guys, but it's not you guys, is it? No. OK. All right. What's involved in understanding desires? So. We have schematic imagery here, um. So these little images here are used to note certain things, so these little hands like this mean I want. I desire it. We're looking at this for a certain reason which we'll get to, OK? This means I don't want it. OK, we're trying to understand human behaviour. So the first thing we're gonna look at here is wants or desires. So young children do understand the subjective nature of desires. You may want an apple and I may not, right? So just think about it, you've got a toddler, you know, eating dinner. You say you have some broccoli, it's the classic, they gon. Um, they understand that someone else wants them to have broccoli, they don't want to have broccoli, OK? Or someone else might eat it and they don't. So the different desires of two individuals are represented schematically, OK, want versus not want, and in this case it's an apple. OK, this one wants the apple, this one does not want the apple. Um. Desires can be construed as a subjective connection between a person and an objective state of affairs. Subjective because it depends from individual to individual, right? But an objective state of affairs, there is now. OK. So it's a complicated way of saying people can differ in how they feel about certain objects. So a subjective understanding can be contrasted with an understanding of mental states as representation. So here, for example, a person on the side of B, um. Thinking that object is an apple. Requires construing B as representing an apple in his mind, OK, so B has to represent an apple in his mind in order to go that is an apple. Yeah. It all sounds very complicated, but it makes sense in a minute. So, um, Just note that desires themselves do not require um. Any kind of representation, you know, any kind of acquisition of the representation by the person that you're the target person, the person you're thinking of, OK? Cause it could be I want. OK, so, All adults, with some exceptions, um, rare exceptions, all kind of healthy normative adults um are belief desire psychologists. OK, we are belief, desire, psychologists, we have a belief, desire framework. At least according to some theorists, OK? Um, and it allows us to do two things, different kind of mental states, OK? Beliefs can explain why two people with identical desires, for example, you and I both want an apple, might do different things. Right? If I think the apple's in the fridge, I'm going to go to the fridge. If you think it's in the cupboard, you're gonna go to the cupboard. Right. These are very basic examples, but we are talking about understanding human behaviour in psychology. So we may not be that interested in explaining why someone goes to the cupboard and when someone goes to the fridge, but imagine extrapolating the idea into more complex things, OK? So beliefs can explain why two people with identical desires might do different things. Similarly, desires can account for why two people with the same beliefs might do different things, OK? Now, um, they might both believe that there's an apple in the fridge. If one person doesn't want it, they're not gonna go and get it. OK, if the other person does want it, they're gonna go and get it. OK. So again, different behaviours, this time not based on beliefs but based on desires. In general, beliefs will trump desire. For the simple fact that if you don't believe and believe is kind of used loosely, it's not so much as a kind of like, you know. It's kind of knowledge state or what you think to be true, thought as well, OK, it's not necessarily just belief, it can be, you know, belief about very simple things. Beliefs Trump desires because if you don't think something is there, if you don't think something is true, you're not gonna do it. OK. More so than desires. OK So in order to understand false beliefs. Um, we need to look at how desire and belief kind of go together. OK, and how we need to separate them, um, in order to understand false beliefs, and then we'll understand why young children don't understand false beliefs. So, here, the chart on the right. Knows that the child on the left likes apples. OK, so that's desire. Knows that that child likes apples. He also knows that the child on the left believes there to be an apple. Right? Simple. Once an apple, believes that there is an apple somewhere. To understand false beliefs, this child on the right needs to be able to think separately about the real state of the world. There is an apple, and the representative state of the world, the child on the left thinks there is an apple. OK, so you've got real state of the world this child on the right has witnessed or even believes or, you know, represents versus the state of the world that's represented, um. By this child. OK, their representation of the world. OK, so, in a classic false belief test situation, which is typically this kind of bucket scenario, you know, the Sally Annold, the puppets? Yeah. Um, here's your subject. Um, here's the kind of protagonist, if you like. So the subject and the story protagonists share a common understanding of the true state of the world. OK, there's an apple in the basket. So right here, both, um, the subject and the protagonist in the story know that there's an apple in the basket. Easy peasy. Then in the absence of the story protagonist, the subject sees the transformation in the true state of the world, so the apple is replaced by a bannon. Right, high stakes drama, right. Apple is replaced by a banana. When the protagonist returns, his belief no longer matches the true state of the world. Right? So the protagonist has a false belief concerning the basket's contents. Yeah. So the true state of the world, according to the subject, is different from the um Represented state of the world based on the belief of the protagonist. Yeah. So now, at that point, we can establish um whether the subject understands that the protagonist has a false belief. So you can either do that by questioning, and the question you would ask is, does the story protagonist, um, or either say, what does the protagonist think is in the basket? In which case they should answer Apple. Yeah, if they answer banana then they haven't understood false beliefs. Right, they're not able to, to differentiate between their knowledge of the world. And they represent a state of the world by the protagonist, yeah. OK, so for the kind of representational theory of mind proponents, there's the this is the key, right? This is this kind of uh representation of the world, um, is the key for understanding theory of mind. Quoted as, the child acquires the ability to represent mental states, to represent mental states, OK, and moves from being a desire psychologist to a belief desire psychologist. Around the age of 4, it begins around the age of 4, sometimes 3, but generally around the age of 4, children start to pass these kind of explicit false belief tasks, right? In other words, they move from being a desire psychologist to a belief desire psychologist, which means effectively, according to these theorists, they are at that point able to represent. Um, ational states of the world in their minds. OK, they can hold that there. Here's an example of what a child looks like when they are a belief psychologist. It's a classic. So, um, my kids used to go, a long time I used to go to the little preschool just over the footbridge over there. A daycare there. And so I used to drive him home every day. And now my son at the time was maybe 3. Right? So before this stage, 223, like he was, um, maybe around the age of 2.5, 3, he was always hungry, always hungry on the way home, right? And he'd go, Can I have a biscuit? Now, sometimes I had a biscuit and all was fine with the world, right? Other times I was out of biscuits and I would say, I'm really sorry, I don't have any biscuits. And he would go, Can I have a biscuit? Now I'm like I'm really sorry, but I do not have a biscuit in the car. Can I have a biscuit? I do not have any biscuits in the car, there are none, none. I can't get, I would love to give you one. I cannot give you one. I want a biscuit. Right, they're desire psychologists. They're going purely on what they want, right? So communicating with them saying the reality of the world is that there is not a biscuit, doesn't really get through, right? It doesn't really hit home. Um, until they're a little bit older. OK, that's why you get kids having weird tantrums about stuff. But partly, not only that, obviously, but um. The way they see the world is different, right? They can't represent the kind of those different ideas so easily. OK, another way to think about this is um. That humans understand or perceive that behaviour is not guided by objective reality. OK, you and my behaviour is not guided by objective reality. We do what we do based on what we believe to be true. Whether that's higher order beliefs or just basic knowledge, right? behaviour is guided by what we want and what we think. Yeah. People always forget this one. I think because it seem, it sounds kind of egocentric, but you can't get an organism to do anything if it doesn't want to do it. It's very, very, very hard. Think of all the experiments you do in the, in the, learn about in the rat labs. You set up an acquired response, right? How on earth do you set up a required response for something that they don't want, you can't? OK, as soon as you punish it, as soon as it's something he doesn't want, it will stop doing it. It's one of the, my mind, one of the biggest issues in the entirety of psychology research is that we are one-sided in our ability to set up these kinds of experiments, so we can only ever look at things from that kind of that bias. Which I think biases the way we think about things. Um, so people's actions are based on their intentions which balance their desires and their beliefs, and this is the complex claim of theory of mind. OK, it's not just about realising that other people have thoughts and opinions and feelings that are different from yours. This is the kind of narrow sense complex claim of theory of mind, OK? People's actions are based on their intentions. Obviously, reality is relevant, OK, but you have to account for the role of beliefs in people's actions. Yeah. OK. Take a balls. We make a little jump, it's not a huge jump. It's a little jump because um kind of mid-eighties. Um This kind of this idea came about, Simon Baron Cohen, which actually it was Uterri's idea, but um, I think Simon Baron Cohen was doing the research at the point. If you haven't heard of him, he is um. Uh, very well known in the area of, uh, autism research. He also is the uncle of Sacha Baron Cohen. Um. So Question, does the autistic child have a theory of mind? OK, that was the question. The reason this question is actually a very sensible question is this. This was the thinking, right? If you can't hold in mind. The other person's represented state of the world, right, so if you can't do that kind of representational state belief desire psychology thing. Does that mean that you would find it very hard, or maybe never assume their point of view? Right? That was, that was the thinking, it makes sense. Um, if you can't assume someone else's point of view, well that's very difficult. Maybe you don't have much motivation to communicate. OK, so this is, you know, 30 years ago, 40, 40 years ago, um, and they're going, let's try and understand. Why we're seeing this kind of features of autism. So Baron Cohen took a sample, 3 samples. They had a sample of children with autism and in the 1980s this would have been autism and Asperger's were different things, right? So when I say autistic, it would have been, uh, what we now count kind of level 3 or more severe, nonverbal. Or less verbal, um, which is why when you look at the chronic chronological age, 11 years, 11 months, nonverbal mental age is 9, verbal mental age is much younger, around 5. They then did something really sensible, they wanted to match this sample with a different sample, OK, um, that was matched in chronological age approximately, but um. Matched also in mental age. Now they couldn't match in terms of nonverbal, so they matched verbal mental age with nonverbal mental age. These are children with Down's syndrome. And then they had their normative sample, um, which were children who are much younger. So you see they're matching across here, they're trying to match in terms of kind of uh. Mental age or chronic, you know, developmental age rather than uh chronological age. OK. Um, And they did the classic, uh, theory of mind task. Sally Ann type thing. What they found is that both typically developing 4 or 5 year olds. And 1011 year old children with Down's syndrome could pass perfectly well, very similar rates of passing. OK. The children with autism had much lower rates of passing. So they kind of concluded that, you know, children with ASD don't really have a theory of mind. But this is where it gets interesting. 4 kids did pass, right? Um, so the question, and it wasn't my question, I can't pretend this is my question, this was the question of Mark Dero who I took over these lectures from about 10 years ago, OK? And this is, this is his research, so I'll, I'll leave it in there, it's really good. His question and his kind of research group question was why did 4 children pass? So they wanted to look at, you know, how does the false belief task, how do people perform in the false belief task, um, if you look at chronological age on the bottom, and the probability of passing. So here we have these normative, uh, children. So you'll see around the age of kind of 4, most about half, just over a passing. By the time you get to 67, the vast majority of kids are passing this task. OK, and this is an explicit test, so it's asking them, you know, what does Johnny think is in the basket? Yeah. What's really interesting is that these are now children with autism. Is that um The curve, there's a yes, it's a squished out curve, but the curve is still there, OK? um. And the question, you know, is this a language? Is this an IQ issue? Um, what about if we include high functioning autism, because they have, um, you know, normal IQ, normal, if not higher, verbal IQ. Um, and what they found is that most children with ASD can pass false belief tasks as long as they have typical intelligence. It just takes them a bit longer. Right? So what we're seeing is, it's more of a kind of delay in this skill set, rather than an inability to do it. So it makes sense, right, if you have loads of studies that test children at the age of 6, some of whom have autism, all the kids without autism pass, those with autism don't pass, you make the conclusion that they can't do it. Right, whereas this study, it looks at age. So by the age of, say, where are we? 10, half of those children are passing. By the time there was that 1213, 14, um, 90%, if more, are passing that task. OK? So interesting, right? Interesting. Um, so what, uh, people thought, including Mark was. Is it actually that there is a deficit in theory of mind in people with um autism, but the, you know. Yeah. Actual chronological age, yeah. Um, so one question that was asked was, you know, maybe they still have a significant, um, difficulty with passing theory of mind tasks, but the Sally Ann task is just too simple to see the deficit. So if we make the tasks harder, would we then see that, you know, people with, um, autism spectrum disorder would then actually not not pass at all? So maybe we need more advanced theory of mind tasks. So you add complexity, basically. So rather than just going, I think you add in, this is a typical I think that he thinks, I think she thinks, I think, right? So you make it more complex, it's harder to follow. Yeah. So read this phrase, right, just read that, read that, read that little thing through. So what you've probably got from that is something along like this. I know you think you understand what you thought I said, but I don't think you realise that what you heard was not what I meant. Now it's kind of complex, but you can follow it, right? It takes a bit of effort. You're like, well, um, but you can follow that. But a 4 year old can't. So a 4 year old can pass a, you know, Sally Ann false belief task, they cannot follow this. So one of the things, you know, one of the ideas is that, that we must get better at this kind of thing but as we age, as we get older, we must get better at following other people's kind of perspectives, complexity. So advanced theory of mind tests are an eclectic mixture of things called social stories. That requires some kind of form of second order reasoning. So second order false belief, which is like a false belief task with another layer, another manipulation. Strange stories tasks aren't genuinely really strange, right? And so they're tasks where um there's typically a social misunderstanding. And they asked the child, or whoever's doing the task, um, was the person right or wrong in what they did? OK. Now I actually find them very strange because I think children can answer differently depending on other factors other than, um, their understanding of theory of mind, you know, like manners and stuff. But these other ones are much simpler, so irony. Making a faux pas, social faux pas, display of rules is your emotional expression, does it match situation, a white lie? Um, you know, pretence of a joke, figure of speech, all those kind of things that are slightly complex parts of social communication. And I'll give you a little anecdote now to help understand this. So when I was about 66, 1717, um, I was a my mum was a tutor, right? Um, and for some reason, I ended up tutoring loads of kids myself, but I ended up tutoring, um, adolescents, right? So, I was 17 and I had a 13-year-old boy who had, um, Asperger's plus ADHD. Lovely boy. And he would come to me just to do homework, right? My only job was to help him get through his homework, really nice kid. And it was fine, every week it was fine. Every now and again you would I would see the little bits that you just couldn't. Process, right? And this was it, we had a comprehension exercise, and the comprehension exercise was based on something that happened in the UK like 150 years ago or something, which is these little girls here, they genuinely tricked, like the British population because they said we've got fairies in our garden. Right, and they'd taken photo, well I don't know if they had, but photographs had been taken of these girls and these fairies right here, OK? And the comprehension explained how this has happened, really famous people like CS Lewis and all that kind of, you know, the people in that kind of zone believed them, so this is true. Um, and the kind of the belief continued for a really long time until basically on her deathbed, one of the sisters said we, we just cut them out. Like we cut them out of the book, um, and it was, it was fake, right? Now, all of that was in the comprehension exercise, including the bit where they said it was, it was fake, right? This poor kid couldn't get beyond the kind of the first part of this thing, which was that it was whether it was real or not. OK, because the, the whole comprehension was saying they were saying it was true. Everyone was saying it was true, there was picture evidence, and then they were saying it wasn't true. And it was really interesting because, you know, normally we didn't have any problems with homework. This was just something that it was, it was too many kind of layers of. You know, false, falseness. So that's just a little thing to kind of the reality of it in, you know, um, what difficulties with theory of mind can look like even with a very high functioning kit. So, typically what you find when you test people with ASD versus typically developing children, you find that they perform worse. OK, you typically find this. But again, Mark's question, um. Was, is there a reporting bias? OK. Typically these studies are very small samples, because it's really hard to recruit um people and kids with ASD. Um, and what tends to happen in psychology in many, many areas is you get reporting bias. So things want to publish positive findings, they don't want to publish negative findings. They want to publish findings that support other findings. So they did a study, so him and his group, as Mark were, they did a group, they did a study where they had 194. Um, school age children and adolescents with high functioning ASD, OK? And compared them to a typically developing comparison group. OK. So, very, very large sample of kids and adolescents with ASD. That's really massive. And then they use this kind of higher order, um, theory of mind tasks to assess in this large sample whether there were significant differences or not. So against this kind of assumed deficit in advanced theory of mind, um. They were kind of really unconvinced, and that's why they did such a large sample, right, that's why they wanted to test it properly, um. So they looked at second order false belief, display rules, the double bluff, which is a complex one, faux pas and sarcasm. This is what they found. So here are the kids. Here are the adolescents, here is your high functioning ASD group, here's your typically developing group, and these are the means and standard deviations. OK? And so what you find is that effectively, where it says contrast P values for the group, that's when they're comparing the high functioning to the typically developing. And there are no significant differences across everything. There are significant age differences. Right? So that's Makes sense, right? As you get older you get better at these kind of things, they're quite verbal, right, they're quite cognitively complex and quite verbal. So for age, there is a significant difference. um. So that was a new result, that was quite a very different kind of new result to be found. Um, so then if we take stock, where are we? It's a bit confusing. So what Mark and his group are saying, and people have said since is that. Children with high functioning ASD, so we're talking normal like you, and we're talking decent, you know, verbal ability. There aren't really that bad at explicit theory of mind at all. OK. Once they can pass the false belief test, and they might be a bit delayed in doing that, but once they can do that, and assuming they have normal IQ, they're equally as good as typically developing children. Right, so we have this delay to first pass that false belief task, but once they can. No differences. So what's going on? So one question that was raised, now, where am I going? All good. One question that was raised is perhaps theory of mind is kind of connected to a developmental variable like verbal ability. OK? It's a very verbal thing. All those things I've shown you, social stories, faux pas, they're presented like verbally, right? Um, and there certainly is some evidence to support that. This is not um causal, because it's correlational, but a meta analysis of 104 studies looked to the association between children's linguistic competence and their false belief understanding. Out of all those 104 studies, only one found a negative association. All the others found a positive association. And the kind of the weight of the arrows here represents the strength of that association. So we have, weirdly, memory for compliments is like memorising things like the blue fish, the giant ball. Right? So, to me, it seems more like a working memory thing, but, um, I'm not a linguist, so I won't comment. But this one, for example, syntax, that's grammar. That's the order of language, um, general language ability. Um, and semantics comes above receptive vocabulary, right? So it doesn't seem to be about their, you know, number of words that they understand, their vocap size. It's more about, um, kind of relationships between stuff. Seemingly, but there is a relationship there. So, is it language? Look, it. Clearly language is required to pass an explicit false belief task, because generally that's how you answer. OK, so it's clearly in there, um. But it doesn't get you far. With a couple of other things. So, do you remember that first graph I showed you, the very first study that looks, looked at passing the false belief task. That Simon Baron Cohen did, so there were 3 groups of kids, there were those with autism, there were those with um Down syndrome, and they were typically developing. Those children with Down's syndrome pass at exactly the same rate as they're typically developing. Do you remember what their verbal IQ was? 2 years, 11 months. Yeah. The nonverbal IQ was about 5, they matched it there, verbal IQ was much lower. So it doesn't really explain. What's going on? Arguably, and I think there is something to this, although I don't know, you know, how far it goes, there's potentially a conceptual relationship between theory of mind and language. So when we talked very early on about this kind of cognitive modules that do stuff, right, this kind of implicit cognitive modules. It's about relationships between stuff. OK, theory of mind is very much understanding and being able to represent things that aren't there. OK? Aspects of kind of verbal ability that are the same. Um So the second question becomes, well, OK, so they don't necessarily have an explicit theory of mind deficit, right, they can pass this task. Once they can pass the false belief task, they're OK. What about an implicit theory of mind deficit? What about that one? So this is where I think it gets really interesting. So do you remember in the infants we showed that little infants when they're doing the, um, watermelon task, right? We showed the watermelon task, the watermelon moves, um, and the looking times of young infants demonstrates that they, at least implicitly. At 9 months old, have false belief understanding. Do you remember that at 6 months old they don't. By the time they get to 9 months old, their eye movements, their eyes are going to where the person would, the other, you know, the experimenter person would put their hand. Understanding that they don't have an, they have a false belief about where the location is, right? So they demonstrate false belief understanding through their eye movements. So this is now looking at the same kind of task in uh. The children tell them adults, no as adults with um Asperger's syndrome. So Asperger's syndrome, for those to be aren't aware is um. Uh, Asperger's used to be something separate from autism. Similar, but a very, a separate diagnosis. They've now lumped it all together. OK? Personally, I don't think they should have done, but I'm not a clinician, so you feel free to completely ignore me. Um, OK, so. Here we have the sample, OK, so we've got uh Asperger's syndrome group and the neurotypical group. um and then we have uh chronological age. So, uh, this is years, yes, I believe so. Adults, yes. 36.8, so they basically, they're matched on age, they're matched on verbal, performance, and full scale IQ. Um, so average to above across both groups. They are, um, the only thing they differ on is the autism quotient. You that there? So that's a kind of, effectively kind of questionnaire, stroke interview thing, um, which makes sense, right? Those with the diagnosis should have higher rates if they didn't, there's an issue with the diagnosis or with your neurotypical group. Um, this is the ADOS, so that's the ADOS score, the other one won't have had that, OK, because it's a clinical thing. There's no difference in terms of um explicit theory of mind or um explicit strange stories, so that's the kind of higher order false belief task, yeah? So there's no difference, again, this is, this is replicating what Mark's big study found. But by the time we get to adults here, there's no difference in ability in terms of basic false belief understanding, um, in terms of theory of mind and strange story performance. This might look familiar, it's now a naughty puppet, it's called the naughty puppet, um. Instead of the magic watermelon. So they're kind of, uh, as in the other experiment, it's very similar. Um, participants are kind of made familiar with A and B. OK? So the puppet placed the ball in one of the two boxes. Both windows were illuminated and a chime sounded. That's the, you know, kind of oriented to what's going on. An actor reached through the window above the box in which the ball was placed and retrieved the ball. OK, so the participants were familiarised with the contingency between B and C. OK, so when it chimes, that's when they're going to put their hand in. Indeed, the puppet moves the ball while the actor is looking away. So this operation induces a false belief in the actor about the location of the ball, right? It's a classic false belief task. But they're not asking the participant where the experiment or the Person with a visor's gonna look, they're just looking at their own eye gaze. And what you find really instantly, despite the fact that the participants with Asperger's syndrome could quite happily with no differences between the neurotypical group, pass those higher order and basic explicit theory of mind tasks, they're very scoring very differently when it comes to eye gaze. OK? So these are, don't worry about the. Exactly what this is, exactly, they're both throwing the same thing, OK? It's about the uh correct circades in each group, so the circade to the box which the person should put their hand in if the other person understands that it has a false belief. OK, it's like an implicit thing. So neurotypicals are looking more often than not, above 0.5 in the correct location. The location that demonstrates they understand. But the lady with the visor has a false belief about the location of the ball. Yeah. Participants with Asperger's are not doing that. So, The implicit deficit In high functioning ASD is plausible. OK, so it looks like that despite the fact that people with ASD, yes, they might be a bit delayed, but they can pass these tasks explicitly, they don't seem to have an implicit, um, Mechanism to do so, yeah. I think they're adults. Uh, yeah, yeah. I think it was an adult test. Yeah, pretty sure. Um They they have to be, they have to get above the age where they are gonna fail explicit ones, do you know what I mean? I think they wanted to rule out the developmental, yeah, um. So it's a bit tricky, OK, so. If we take stock for a minute, we know that apes are pretty sophisticated and they have loads of this kind of precursor skills or what we call precursor skills, but remember we've got issues with age, yeah. Um, they can do mirror self recognition, they can demonstrate an element of joint attention, um. They could do the kind of, you know, goals and uh intentions. They also potentially have um social referencing as well. But they fail explicit false belief understanding tasks. Remember that, they fail those tasks, right? So do apes just lack language? Is this the issue? Um, no, it's not. So as we've seen, you know, with the, um, sample versus of the kids with, um, Down syndrome, it, there's a relationship with language. It doesn't seem to cut it, really, because there's high functioning kids with ASD. A good explicit theory of mind and poor implicit theory of mind, so how can that be? Here's the interesting thing, right? This is where it gets really cool. I told you we'd jump around. This is almost the last jumping around, I promise. Um, so this is a study in 2017, um. This is in chimpanzees. So these are chimpanzees that do you remember they failed that task, they couldn't track another person's mental state and keep, you know, at the same time, cognitive load seemed to be too high, um. This paper showed evidence of false belief tracking in apes using an implicit measure. Eye tracking. OK, so they eye tracked the apes. So despite the fact that apes can't really gaze hollow, we just looked at what, where they were looking, right? um. So now we have a situation where. 15 month old infants, in fact 9 month old infants, and great apes, demonstrate implicit false belief understanding. Right, so their eye gaze, if nothing else, shows that at least part of their brain. is able to take on the perspective of another person. And then by 4 years old, your typically developing children can pass the explicit false belief tasks. But the apes do not. Right, so the apes have got the implicit bit, they don't seem to be able to do the explicit bit. Their behaviour doesn't follow on from what their eye tracking is doing. In the opposite direction, individuals with high functioning ASD. They can learn to pass explicit false belief tasks. It takes them a bit longer, but they can learn to do it, um, but they do not seem to demonstrate implicit false belief. So Like for me, I'm quite interested in the implicit explicit differentiation. Because what does that mean? What does it actually mean? How do we actually develop the theory of mind? Is it one process? Is it just one process that develops through, you know, early childhood, and we go, oh yes, we can do it implicitly when we're tiny, and then by the time we're 4, we've, like, that's, that's translated into this kind of ability that we can demonstrate behaviorally, cognitively. If that's the case, then how is it possible that one group of people do not have that implicit process? And yet can develop explicit theory of mind. Now one argument, as with many things, right, is that Um, kind of instruction. Teaching things in a kind of top down way is just another route to the same end. Right, if you think of and bottom up top down is a kind of controversial thing, I don't wanna kind of go there. I don't wanna, um, but if you think of eye gaze potentially as being more of an automatic. Process, right, it just kind of happens, there's some kind of social system within you that makes you do that. A top-down process is one that kind of requires cognition and understanding to go down in that direction, right? So maybe it's possible that for kids with high functioning ASD that kind of bottom up process. Isn't there for whatever reason. But they can compensate from the top down. That's why it takes them longer. Now I don't know this potentially as we're saying it's a, it's a possibility, right? It may just be that the way we measure it isn't right for kids with ASD. I don't know. But that's one possibility. So there's not one pathway, there's two. Right now typically developing, they work together, maybe when things aren't typical, they go in different directions. Because we see a similar thing in our chimpanzees where we have the implicit one is working, so the process that we think might drive everything else is working, but perhaps the cognitive load or the cognitive capability to hold that all together in a kind of formalised represental representational state is not there. OK, it's too complex. Potentially. It's a very interesting area. For anyone who's interested. Right, there is a little link to, so we're talking about these chimps all the time. Hopefully that still works. I did check it. Um, this is Kanzi, the chimpanzee, who is one of the subjects in, like, loads of these kind of studies. Um, so it's just a little, if you want a bit of a break, you can watch the chimpanzee do really cool stuff. OK? That is the end for now, we have a little break time. Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect. Let's come back in 10, 888.
