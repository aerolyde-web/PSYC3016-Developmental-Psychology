<div class="section-header">THEORY OF MIND (L05-L07)</div>

<div class="template">
    <h2>Explain the Two-Pathway Hypothesis and evidence for it.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><span class="open">The Two-Pathway Hypothesis proposes that Theory of Mind comprises two computationally independent systems that develop asynchronously.</span> <span class="key">Implicit ToM</span> is fast, automatic, and unconscious, emerging around <span class="stat">15 months</span> as demonstrated by <span class="cite">Onishi & Baillargeon (2005)</span>, who found infants looked significantly longer at belief-incongruent actions (<span class="stat">39.3s vs 29.1s</span>). This system is shared with great apes and relies on the mirror neuron system.</p>
        <p><span class="key">Explicit ToM</span> is slow, deliberate, and conscious, emerging around <span class="stat">age 4-5</span> as measured by verbal prediction tasks like Sally-Anne, where <span class="stat">~85% of 4-year-olds pass versus ~20% of 3-year-olds</span>. This system is uniquely human and requires the mentalizing network (mPFC, TPJ).</p>
        <p>The systems' independence is proven by <span class="key">double dissociation</span>: great apes pass implicit but fail explicit tasks, while <span class="cite">Senju et al.</span> showed HFASD adults fail implicit (no anticipatory gaze) despite passing explicit tasks verbally. Additionally, Down Syndrome children pass Sally-Anne at <span class="stat">86%</span> despite lower IQ than ASD children who fail at <span class="stat">80%</span>, proving ToM is modular rather than a function of general intelligence.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="template">
    <h2>Describe the developmental precursors to Theory of Mind.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><span class="open">Theory of Mind develops through a sequence of precursor abilities that build upon each other from infancy.</span> The <span class="key">9-month revolution</span> marks the shift from dyadic to triadic attention, with <span class="cite">Carpenter et al.</span> finding joint attention at 9 months predicts language at 24 months (<span class="stat">r = .52</span>). Failure at this stage is an early ASD risk marker.</p>
        <p>By <span class="stat">12 months</span>, infants demonstrate <span class="key">social referencing</span>—<span class="cite">Sorce et al.</span> showed <span class="stat">0% crossed</span> the visual cliff when mothers displayed fear versus <span class="stat">74% with joy</span>. <span class="cite">Liszkowski</span> found infants selectively point to inform uninformed adults (<span class="stat">2.1:1 ratio</span>).</p>
        <p><span class="key">Implicit false belief</span> emerges at <span class="stat">15 months</span> (Onishi & Baillargeon), followed by <span class="key">desire understanding</span> at <span class="stat">18 months</span>—<span class="cite">Repacholi & Gopnik's</span> broccoli task showed 18-month-olds give the experimenter's preference, not their own. Desire precedes belief because desires are always "true" while beliefs require meta-representation to understand they can be false. <span class="key">Explicit false belief</span> finally emerges at <span class="stat">4-5 years</span> when prefrontal maturation enables inhibitory control over reality bias.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="template">
    <h2>What does the ASD vs Down Syndrome comparison reveal about ToM?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><span class="open">The comparison between ASD and Down Syndrome provides critical evidence that Theory of Mind is domain-specific and modular rather than a function of general intelligence.</span> <span class="cite">Baron-Cohen et al. (1985)</span> found that children with Down Syndrome passed the Sally-Anne task at <span class="stat">86%</span>—equivalent to typically developing controls—despite having significantly lower IQ than children with ASD.</p>
        <p>In striking contrast, children with ASD failed at <span class="stat">80%</span> despite their higher cognitive abilities. If ToM were simply "being smart about people," higher-IQ ASD children should outperform lower-IQ DS children. The opposite result demonstrates that ToM involves <span class="key">dedicated cognitive architecture</span> that can be selectively impaired (ASD) or spared (DS) independent of general intelligence.</p>
        <p>This pattern constitutes a <span class="key">double dissociation</span> that proves ToM is modular. Further evidence from <span class="cite">Senju et al.</span> shows that even high-functioning ASD adults who pass explicit ToM tasks verbally fail implicit ToM measures (no anticipatory gaze), suggesting they compensate through learned rules rather than automatic social cognition. Teaching explicit rules does not restore implicit processing.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="template">
    <h2>What is shared intentionality and why is it uniquely human?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><span class="open">Shared intentionality, described by <span class="cite">Tomasello</span> as "we-mode" psychology, refers to the capacity to establish joint goals, mutual knowledge, and collaborative roles toward common purposes.</span> This capacity underlies human cultural cognition, enabling language, morality, and social institutions.</p>
        <p>While great apes share <span class="key">implicit ToM</span> with humans—passing violation-of-expectation paradigms—they lack shared intentionality. Apes collaborate only when each individual action independently yields reward; they cannot coordinate complementary roles toward a shared goal. Critically, <span class="cite">Liszkowski</span> demonstrated that human 12-month-olds point <span class="key">declaratively</span> to share information, while chimpanzees never point to inform—only to request (imperative pointing).</p>
        <p>The neural basis for this uniqueness lies in the elaboration of the <span class="key">mentalizing network</span> (mPFC, TPJ) in humans, which supports explicit ToM and enables the recursive representation of shared mental states ("I know that you know that I know"). This capacity for establishing <span class="key">common ground</span> is what makes human cooperation, teaching, and cumulative culture possible.</p>

<div class="section-header">MORAL DEVELOPMENT (L08-L09)</div>

<div class="template">
    <h2>Explain the prerequisites for moral agency and their developmental sequence.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><span class="open">Moral agency—the capacity to be held responsible for one's actions—requires a developmental cascade of cognitive achievements that must emerge in a specific sequence.</span> The first prerequisite is <span class="key">self-awareness</span>, demonstrated by mirror self-recognition emerging around <span class="stat">18-24 months</span> (Rouge test: <span class="stat">~25% at 18mo → ~70% at 24mo</span>). Without recognizing oneself as a distinct entity, the concept "I did something wrong" is meaningless.</p>
        <p>The second prerequisite is <span class="key">Theory of Mind</span>, emerging around <span class="stat">age 4</span> with false belief understanding. Moral judgment requires understanding that others are mental agents whose behavior stems from beliefs and intentions. Building on this, <span class="key">intention reading</span> enables distinguishing accidental from intentional harm—crucial for attributing moral responsibility.</p>
        <p>Each stage is <span class="key">necessary but not sufficient</span> for the next. Self-awareness enables but doesn't guarantee ToM; ToM enables but doesn't guarantee mature moral judgment. This cascade explains why moral development continues well past basic ToM acquisition—the prerequisites are in place, but the moral reasoning system that depends on them continues maturing through childhood.</p>

    <h2>Describe Kohlberg's stages and the main critiques of his theory.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><span class="open">Kohlberg proposed six stages of moral reasoning across three levels, measuring the structure of reasoning rather than behavioral outcomes.</span> The <span class="key">Pre-Conventional level</span> (Stages 1-2) focuses on punishment avoidance and self-interest, requiring no ToM. The <span class="key">Conventional level</span> (Stages 3-4) involves social approval and law maintenance, requires ToM, and characterizes <span class="stat">most adults</span>. The <span class="key">Post-Conventional level</span> (Stages 5-6) involves social contracts and universal principles, achieved by only <span class="stat">10-15%</span> (Stage 5) and <span class="stat">~1%</span> (Stage 6).</p>
        <p>Seven major critiques challenge the theory: (1) reasoning doesn't predict behavior; (2) <span class="cite">Gilligan (1982)</span> identified gender bias from the all-male sample, arguing care ethics (Stage 3) was unfairly ranked below justice (Stage 4); (3) cultural bias favors Western individualism; (4) people show different stages across contexts; (5) hypothetical dilemmas lack ecological validity; (6) young children can't articulate reasoning they possess; (7) Stage 6 is too rare to validate empirically.</p>
        <p>Gilligan's critique is particularly significant: she argued that <span class="key">care</span> (emphasizing relationships) and <span class="key">justice</span> (emphasizing rules) represent equally valid moral orientations rather than a developmental hierarchy. The theory's greatest limitation remains that knowing the right thing (reasoning) doesn't predict doing the right thing (behavior).</p>

<div class="template">
    <h2>Explain the Moral-Conventional Distinction and what it reveals about early moral cognition.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><span class="open">Social Domain Theory (<span class="cite">Turiel, 1983</span>) proposes that moral rules and social conventions constitute distinct cognitive domains distinguished by three diagnostic criteria.</span> <span class="key">Moral transgressions</span> (hitting, stealing) are authority-independent (wrong even if permitted), rule-independent (wrong even without explicit rules), and universal (wrong anywhere). <span class="key">Social conventions</span> (dress codes, table manners) show the opposite pattern—dependent on authority, rules, and context.</p>
        <p><span class="cite">Smetana (1981)</span> demonstrated that children as young as <span class="stat">30 months</span> reliably distinguish moral from conventional transgressions, with <span class="stat">no significant age differences</span> from 30-57 months. This remarkably early emergence challenges Kohlberg's stage theory, suggesting children possess sophisticated domain-specific moral intuitions before they can articulate stage-based reasoning.</p>
        <p>The <span class="key">Harm Principle</span> explains domain boundaries: adding harm to any behavior converts it from conventional to moral. Eating with hands is merely unconventional, but if it somehow harmed someone, it becomes a moral transgression. This early M/C discrimination suggests morality may be foundational rather than derived from general cognitive development, with the presence of a victim or harm serving as the critical factor that triggers moral—rather than conventional—reasoning.</p>

<div class="template">
    <h2>Explain Blair's Violence Inhibition Mechanism and what psychopathy reveals about morality.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><span class="open">Blair's Violence Inhibition Mechanism (VIM) proposes that moral development depends on an innate emotional system that responds aversively to others' distress cues.</span> When typically developing individuals perceive distress signals—crying, fearful expressions—the VIM activates, producing autonomic arousal and aversive affect that inhibits aggression. Through development, this creates associations between harmful actions and negative emotions, providing the <span class="key">affective foundation</span> for distinguishing moral from conventional transgressions.</p>
        <p>Psychopathy provides crucial evidence through a natural dissociation. Individuals with high psychopathic traits show <span class="stat">2.14 times more errors</span> (<span class="stat">4.73 vs 2.20</span>) recognizing fear and sadness specifically, with normal recognition of other emotions. Critically, <span class="cite">Blair</span> demonstrated they show a <span class="stat">33% smaller</span> moral-conventional distinction gap (<span class="stat">1.23 vs 1.84</span>), treating moral transgressions as if they were merely rule violations.</p>
        <p>This pattern—intact reasoning plus impaired emotion equals moral deficits—proves that emotion is <span class="key">necessary</span>, not merely helpful, for moral development. The <span class="key">Sentimentalist tradition</span> (Hume, Darwin, Blair) argues that Kohlberg's purely cognitive approach missed the emotional substrate that makes moral distinctions possible. Without the aversive response to distress, you can learn rules about what's prohibited but cannot distinguish intrinsically wrong acts from merely rule-dependent ones.</p>

<div class="template">
    <h2>Describe the Happy Victimizer paradigm and what it reveals about moral development.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><span class="open">The Happy Victimizer paradigm (<span class="cite">Nunner-Winkler & Sodian, 1988</span>) ingeniously separates moral knowledge from moral emotion by asking children not whether an act is wrong, but how the wrongdoer feels afterward.</span> A protagonist chooses self-interest over morality (e.g., stealing a toy). All ages judge stealing as wrong, but when asked "How does the protagonist feel?", young children predict positive emotions while older children predict guilt.</p>
        <p>The developmental trajectory shows: age 4-5 predict "happy" (<span class="stat">+1.35</span> on a -2 to +2 scale), shifting through mixed emotions at 5-7, to guilt at age 8+ (<span class="stat">-0.50</span>)—a total shift of <span class="stat">1.85 units</span>. This reveals that moral <span class="key">knowledge</span> precedes emotional <span class="key">binding</span>: young children know stealing is wrong but don't yet anticipate the emotional consequences.</p>
        <p>Importantly, HV at ages 4-5 is a <span class="key">normal developmental stage</span>, not early psychopathy—it only indicates problems if it persists past age 8. <span class="cite">Krettenauer et al. (2008)</span> showed priming affects responses: focusing children on moral evaluation increases guilt attribution, while focusing on desires increases HV responses. This explains the knowledge-behavior gap: knowing something is wrong is insufficient if that knowledge isn't emotionally resonant enough to generate anticipatory guilt that deters transgression.</p>

<div class="template">
    <h2>How does intention-outcome weighting develop in moral judgment?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><span class="open"><span class="cite">Piaget (1932)</span> first documented that young children's moral judgments focus primarily on outcomes rather than intentions—a phenomenon called moral realism.</span> In his classic comparison, children under 7 judge accidentally breaking 15 cups as worse than intentionally breaking 1 cup while misbehaving. <span class="cite">Heyman & Gelman (1998)</span> systematically quantified this using crossed intention-by-outcome designs.</p>
        <p>Development involves a <span class="key">shift in weighting</span>, not a binary switch. The judgment formula J = α×Intention + β×Outcome shows kindergarteners weight outcomes heavily (<span class="stat">5:1 ratio</span>; α=0.3, β=0.7), while adults weight intentions (<span class="stat">4:1 ratio</span>; α=0.8, β=0.2). Critically, young children use <span class="key">both</span> information sources—they don't ignore intentions entirely but simply give them less weight.</p>
        <p>This shift depends on <span class="key">Theory of Mind</span>—you cannot weight intentions you cannot represent. <span class="cite">Killen et al. (2011)</span> showed false belief understanding predicts earlier transition to intention-weighted judgment. Outcomes never become irrelevant even in adults (accidental harm still generates some liability), but intention becomes the primary factor. The developmental achievement is giving intentions <span class="key">priority</span>, not exclusivity, in moral evaluation.</p>

<div class="template">
    <h2>What does the Malti & Krettenauer meta-analysis reveal about moral emotion and behavior?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><span class="open"><span class="cite">Malti & Krettenauer's (2013)</span> meta-analysis of 42 studies (n > 8,000) provides the most comprehensive evidence that moral emotions—particularly guilt—predict actual moral behavior.</span> The analysis revealed effect sizes of <span class="stat">r = +0.20</span> for guilt predicting prosocial behavior and <span class="stat">r = -0.35</span> for guilt predicting reduced antisocial behavior.</p>
        <p>The <span class="key">asymmetry</span> between these effects (1.75× stronger for antisocial) reveals guilt's functional nature as an <span class="key">inhibitory mechanism</span>—"emotional brakes" that prevent transgression by generating anticipated negative affect. Guilt can stop you from harming but doesn't create motivation to help. This explains why interventions focused solely on guilt may effectively reduce harmful behavior but be insufficient for promoting active prosociality.</p>
        <p>These findings validate the <span class="key">Sentimentalist position</span> that moral development involves more than cognitive understanding—emotional engagement with moral rules is necessary for behavioral compliance. The findings also connect to Happy Victimizer research: children who attribute guilt to wrongdoers are themselves less likely to transgress. Building prosocial behavior may require cultivating additional emotions like empathic concern and pride in helping that provide positive motivation beyond mere guilt avoidance.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="template">
    <h2>Compare Rationalist and Sentimentalist approaches to moral development.</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><span class="open">The Rationalist tradition, exemplified by Kohlberg, proposes that moral behavior flows from moral reasoning: THINK → BEHAVE.</span> This approach focuses on cognitive stages of moral judgment, using dilemmas to assess reasoning structure independent of content. However, Kohlberg's stages only weakly predict actual behavior (<span class="stat">r = .30-.40</span> per <span class="cite">Blasi, 1980</span>), and <span class="stat">most adults</span> remain at conventional stages (3-4) rather than reaching post-conventional reasoning.</p>
        <p>The <span class="key">Sentimentalist tradition</span> (Hume, Darwin, Blair) proposes that moral behavior flows from moral emotion: FEEL → BEHAVE. Darwin's dual-instinct model suggests guilt emerges when persistent social instincts outweigh fading appetitive instincts after transgression. Blair's VIM model shows distress cues trigger autonomic responses that inhibit aggression—and when this system is impaired (psychopathy), the moral-conventional distinction collapses despite intact reasoning.</p>
        <p>Evidence favors <span class="key">integration</span>: neither approach alone predicts behavior. Psychopathy demonstrates reasoning intact + emotion impaired = moral deficits. The Happy Victimizer paradigm shows knowledge without emotional binding fails to deter transgression. <span class="cite">Malti's</span> meta-analysis confirms moral emotion predicts behavior (<span class="stat">r = -.35</span> for antisocial). Modern approaches recognize that mature moral functioning requires both cognitive understanding AND affective binding working together.</p>
