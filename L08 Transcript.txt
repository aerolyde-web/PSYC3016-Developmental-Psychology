Did everyone have a nice little break, get a coffee, etc. Guys, I'm gonna need you to be quiet a bit quicker. Thank you, just because we are actually quite pushed for time and I want to give you a big break. Thank you. Um, But we do have to be quiet quite quickly, OK? Thank you. Alright. We are changing topic. So wipe everything I do wipe. Everything that you just heard, refresh. New topic So we're now looking at moral development. OK, there will be overlapping bits, as I will try and point out as we go. OK? So there's 2 lectures on this topic, this one and the first one from next week. OK, here are some recommended reading. Oh, hang on, hang on. That's why you were noisy, right. Give it a second. Here we go, moral development, excellent. Um, this is recommended reading. You do not have to read these, there will be no exam questions specifically about these um papers. They are here to help you out, OK? So if you want to learn more, if you find it interesting, if you're not sure, these are the ones that will help you out, OK? I think the one of them. I can't remember which 11 of them pops back in as a required reading, but I will tell you when that happens. OK, maybe in a tutorial, I can't remember. As in required for the tutorial, not for exam. But don't worry about that for now. OK. So before we start looking at moral development, we really need to answer this question, OK? I'm just gonna be really annoying, right? I did work at a school for a while, and I did work at quite a school for quite naughty children. Um, I have a real issue when I can hear background noise. I don't know if I've got very sensitive hearing. If I can hear background noise, I cannot concentrate. OK? So I do need you to be quiet, if that's all right. If you have an emergency, please feel free to talk to your neighbour, but otherwise, I, I'd appreciate it. Thank you. So, right, what are Morals. First question, OK? Are they just a code? Are they a set of rules? Have we, have we made them up? And to what extent are they universal or are they content specific? OK. Um, if you've done any philosophy units, if you just read books at high school, you should have come across these kind of questions before, OK? Um, one of the kind of more important questions for this course is, is it a thought? Is it reason or is it an emotion? Is it purely something that we've evolved to survive better? Start getting some big questions when you think about what morals are, particularly, are they black and white or are they grey? OK. So this is what we're going to do today in the next lecture, so we're gonna discuss some important developmental components of conscience and the growth of moral understanding. Introduce classical cognitive developmental theories and contrast, this will be next, next one. Contrast the classical approach with the social domain theory approach. I won't go through the learning outcomes because you can go through them by yourself. OK. So this should ring a bell from last week when we were looking at social cognition in that self-awareness. So, in other words, the concept of self emerges around 18 months. Half of the kids at age 2 can pass the rouge test. Yep. So that's that kind of self-awareness, a self-concept. Um, this kind of identity formation in some ways is thought to kind of be a lessening of egocentricity and suddenly an increase to self other differentiation. OK? More of an awareness that there are other important agents. Around you. OK and we'll look at what this looks like in terms of moral development in a second. So. This sense of self, as we saw in social cognition, we saw this was required, right? If you don't have a sense of self, you can't really have any kind of social function, right? Um, same way in terms of being a moral agent, if you does not exist, then you have no responsibilities. Right? If there's no you, there's no entity that you are responsible for, then what does it matter what you do or what you say? Quite interestingly, very young children around the age of 2. They will display things like pride, embarrassment, shame. Um, although it's quite hard to interpret what they're expressing, right, because they're 2, but they will express those things. A side note, there's been loads of stuff recently, well, not recently. Maybe quite recently, um, this whole big idea that shame is a really bad emotion. Shame is not a really bad bad emotion, shame is a really useful emotion. Incorrect allocation of shame, yes, it's a very bad emotion, right? So shame put on a child when it's not meant to be there, very, very bad. But more generally, Shame is an emotion that stops you from doing things that you shouldn't have done. Right, you go, oo. I feel really bad. OK, bad emotions are good. So young kids can explain these things. What's interesting though is that um. They're very much linked to the circumstances. So if a child at that age, pride is not the same as happiness, it's certainly something different, shame is not the same as sadness. These are social emotions. So at that age, they only happen when there's an audience. OK. If you've ever babysat, if you've got younger siblings, if you've babysat for young kids and you've been. You've had the pleasure of sitting through some kind of performance from, you know, 34 year old kids, um. Yeah, you see that the pride, right? It seems as you're like, yeah. Um, they, they show it, like, they're happy, that's that's a pride, that's an experience of pride. Um, what's different though, is that by the time they get to 8, they're able to feel that emotion in the absence of an audience. OK, they effective they can internalise it. So at 2, they can't internalise, um. So they will only experience these social emotions when an audience is there providing feedback, and by the time they get to around 8 years old, they can kind of appraise their own behaviour. Yeah, so they've kind of moved out into the kind of effectively external feedback has been integrated internally. Yeah. We should make you think about what how important it might be. For that external feedback to be appropriate, right, as you grow up, because it's informing how you feel about the stuff that you're doing. OK. Um, What these self-conscious emotions do, all these social emotions do is that um. There has to be some awareness or some kind of consideration about your actions as being kind of good or bad, right? Shame being the bad one, guilt being the bad one, pride being the good one. Yeah, there has to be some kind of appraisal of the behaviour itself. And it probably comes about from experiences up until that point, OK? As they get older, the audience becomes less important, yeah. That's right. I was just in, yes, they're not exactly the same thing, so self-conscious would be more that kind of, well, literally self-consciousness about the self. Yeah, exactly. So pride, emotions, social emotions could be anything that involves. More than the others. Yeah, that makes sense. Sorry, that's me being lazy. OK. So when we look at classical theories of moral moral development, Piaget, you will have heard of, Kohlberg, who was kind of following on from Piaget's traditions, they use these structured tasks or similar to clinical interviews, actually, um, to establish how, be careful about this, how are they able to reason. About moral dilemmas or ethical situations. In other words, they were interested to find out what kids thought should be done, or what the right response was, right? So, specifically, what should be done, not would that individual do, right? Not, not what would the kids do, but what the kid thinks should be done. So they give examples like this. So one afternoon on a holiday, a mother had taken her children for a walk along the road. At 4 o'clock she gave each of them a roll. They all began to eat their rolls except the youngest, who was careless, and let his fall into the water. What will the mother do? Will she give him another one? What will the older ones say? So what you can see straight away is there are multiple options. There are multiple ways you can answer that. OK, you might say the mum was took pity on the kid and gave it another role, or gave the child her role. It might be the siblings told him off. um, it might be that they said you lost it, it's your problem. There are multiple ways you can answer that scenario, OK? Um And what Piaget and more so Kohlberg concluded is that there's a, well, what they thought is that there's a clear developmental sequence. Not just in the child's capacity, but in child all the way to adulthood, capacity to reason about moral dilemmas. And when we talk about Piaget, you should be thinking about like concrete stages, hierarchical processes, right, which is what they thought was going on. So moral reasoning is the cognitive component of moral development. OK, the thinking side. So working out what you should do in any given situation. And to look at this in more detail, we're going to study Kohlberg's stages of moral reasoning. So A little bit of background first of all, um. So Kohlberg From his research, um. Proposed that there were 3 main levels, moral reasoning, um, with kind of 2 stages in each one. OK, so 6 stages overall. And that as you become more cognitively mature, effectively as you age, typically, um, you kind of progress through these stages and each stage is effectively better, right, or qualitatively, um, different, right? But they're more adequate. And again he used this kind of moral judgement interview to do this. That one example that I gave you will be one scenario, there'll be multiple scenarios, OK. So the idea here is discrete stages and hierarchical structure. OK, that we're moving through through childhood and adolescence and adulthood. OK, so here they are. As you can see, there are 6 stages, and they kind of go from the start here, and they go all the way up to up here. We're gonna look at each one in turn. So Um, Stage one, we have pre-conventional morality. Now, as the name suggests, pre-conventional, um, this is the one that comes kind of before the level of, um, morality that most people Kind of sit at, according to Kohlberg, OK? So we're talking about quite young kids here. Stage 2 is conventional morality, that's where most kind of adolescents and adults sit, according to this research. And then post-conventional morality is um less common, so limited to kind of adults um and we'll see some uh. Issues with these in a minute. OK. So level one, preconventional morality. This is typical of kind of early childhood, and the idea here is that the child kind of understands. Uh, what's right and wrong in terms of moral, what kind of should be done in terms of external consequences, and it's very much kind of negatively focused. So effectively the child. Will behave in a way and suggest other people should behave in a way that avoids punishment. So the reverse logic is true, right, if you say to someone, um. If it, if they, if the kid finds out someone else was punished, they will think, well, they must have done something wrong. That's an immediate response, OK, because the outcome, the punishment outcome at this stage of moral reasoning dictates that something morally wrong has been done. So for example, um. If you ask a kid, you know, is it wrong to draw on the wall? At this age, it's not that they would say. They're not gonna say, you know, no, because this house belongs to my parents and they pay for it and, you know, that gives them work to do to clean it off. It would be, yes, it's wrong because I got told off for it. Right, it's that kind of that kind of relationship between moral reasoning. OK. Early to mid childhood. We're at the next stage, um, which is very similar actually, so it's still very self-focused. At this stage, at the pre-conventional stage, moral reasoning is completely self-focused, right? The opinions of kind of the outside other people does not feature yet, so it's egocentric. Um, it's very much to do with, uh, what's best for me. OK, so effectively, it's kind of the same thing, but it's now looking more like a reward, right? So if someone goes, um, if you do your homework, I'll take you to the cinema. You know, is it right to do your homework? Yes. Why? Answer is not because it will make me better equipped to pass my exams, the answer is because I get to go to the cinema. So a different type of moral reasoning. Um As a point to consider, but later on. OK. So that's kind of early, mid childhood. When we start looking at adolescence, and to be honest, this is where it gets most interesting, I think, um, because don't forget the younger ages are also limited by just kind of cognitive capacity, right? It's not just about the fact that that's how they reason morally. It's also if you're 3 or 4 years old. You know, think about what we just talked about in terms of theory of mind, right? Can you expect a 3 or 4 year old to go, oh yeah, you know, I mustn't, I mustn't draw on the wall because, you know, that would be upsetting to my parent. That kind of cognitive jump is, is probably not there yet. OK? OK, so The first level, interpersonal accord and conformity. Typical for adults and adolescents, for the first time now we're seeing external um input coming in. So for the first time, this stage of moral reasoning takes account of the views and expectations of society. Right, sometimes this level is nicknamed good girl or good boy. I mean in other words, um. For example, right? Uh, I'm gonna say a Boy Scout, but that's probably too young for adolescence. So, you know, some, some kid, um, year 10, let's say, walking home from school, sees an elderly person needing to cross the road. They might consider the right thing to do is help that person across the road. OK? The reason they think that if they're at this stage of moral reasoning is because that's what they think society expects them to do or thinks that they should do. Right? So it's kind of an externally driven, um. Expectation, if you like. The next one, which is still within this conventional morality, is all about maintaining social order. So the idea that what should be done should be whatever maintains laws and social conventions, right? So whatever the rules are, you want to stay within those rules. Um Interestingly, this is still, if you think about it, it's still very bound by the expectations of society, but this is more about the laws of society than the kind of social expectations of behaviour, right? But it still goes beyond the individual. What I mean by that is that. The person at this stage of moral reasoning may think the right thing to do, what they should do, is something that may not benefit them. So, best example I could think of, oh, is this. Um, imagine, you know, 15 year old girls, a group of them. Uh, go into a shop and, um, one of them decides they're gonna nick something. Right, so they, you know, steal it. um, it's all hilarious. And one of the people, one of the girls in that group. Is very much at this stage, OK? Their behaviour might be to go and report the theft of the shopkeeper, right, they might, or they might tell a parent at home. So they're following the laws and social conventions, despite the fact it probably means that those friends are never gonna speak to her, or at least not for a week. Right, so there's a, there's a negative impact. On that person for that behaviour, but they're behaving at the level that they think is, uh, this kind of law following um level. OK. OK. By the way, there are some criticisms of this model, which we'll have a look at in a minute. So if you're sitting there thinking, I'm not sure this, this, this flies, we'll have a look um at that in a minute. So. Post-conventional, um, only about 10 to 15% of the adult population exists at this level or higher. You know what's really fascinating, it is really fascinating is that I think everyone, everyone thinks they sit at this level or the one above. Right, when they think about their own kind of moral reasoning, they're like, who, on this, on this level, right, and that's not, that's not an egocentric thing, that is very understandable because it's very difficult to actually work out what is motivating your moral reasoning, OK? And we'll look at that in a sec. So at this level is the idea that laws and social rules are not set in stone, OK? Um. Rules can be changed by the majority to benefit the majority. OK, so for example, the best example, I keep trying to come up with examples, um, Jean Valjean, right, stole food to feed a child, went to prison for like 70,000 years, um. But French Revolution, right, so you have a population where the majority is looking to change the rules for the majority. As an example. I think the difficult thing here is that people think they're at this level because they think, well, I'm open to other people's opinions and beliefs, right? I respect those. I'm happy for things to be changed. And what actually is true is that they're actually at the one where most people are, which is the interpersonal accord and conformity, right? Because they're the same as their group. So it might be that You know, That's true, right, that they do respect other people's beliefs, etc. etc. But if their social group change, perhaps they wouldn't. So it's very, do you see what I mean? So it's very hard to see what, you know, is your thought kind of independent at that level, which we'll see at the next level, which is very rare, or not? And that's not a criticism of people, because, you know, including me there as well. Um, and that's kind of social function, right? Most people exist at this kind of middle level. Yeah. It's Yeah, so this one, so the all these kind of Kohlberg things come from his original research, right, which I will discuss in a minute, which is all these different scenarios. So it's how people responded to those scenarios. Yeah, what I can't tell you is the is the exact coding, so I don't know how, how many they would need to respond into one bracket in order to kind of reach that level. I'm not, I'm not sure on that. Um, OK, so that's post-conventional social contract orientation. The final one. It's one of universal ethical principles. So at this level, considered very rare, um, kind of, basically beyond the law. So you're talking about an individual who goes, these are my, uh, values, um, and They're kind of, one, they're overarching, so the ethical principles that kind of go across everything else, but also influence their behaviour similarly. So what they should do, um. Is based on these principles rather than kind of contextual factors or situational factors, etc. So yeah, but again, struggling to come up with an example. The closest one I can get, I think, is this guy. You heard of him? Bonhoffer? Yeah. Um, so he was a very interesting man in that he was both, it says there, if you can read it really tiny. Um, so this is during the Second World War. He lived in Germany, Austria, Germany, Germany, Berlin, thank you. Um, in Germany. Um, and he was a pastor, right? So a Christian theologian. And pastor, and he basically believed that what Hitler was doing was wrong. Right? Um, but he also believed that obviously killing was wrong. Right, um, but his kind of overarching principles were that, was that what Hitler was doing was so bad he needed to stop him. So he became a spy. Um, and very nearly assassinated Hitler. So the book is fascinating. It's really fascinating character, really fascinating. Um, but you see what I mean? So it's like he was doing that, so it can't be social contract. It can't be social contract because the society he was living in was not following the same beliefs as he was, for the vast majority. Yeah. Hm Where would they fit in? Oh, they're doing it, when you say doing it for self-preservation, yeah. No, go for it. Yeah. Mm Well, it's really interesting because you can't actually tell just from behaviour. You can't. It is why these are kind of interviews where you ask, what should you be, what should you do? Right? So there's, there's, um, and this is why these examples are difficult, right? Because I'm inferring from behaviour what might be a certain kind of mentality or certain view of what should be done. But you can't actually do that, right? So, um, in a minute, we'll look at examples that makes it quite difficult to know. But it raises the whole question of, um, You know, what is the relevance of moral reasoning? And to what extent does it actually translate to behaviour, because in some ways that's all we really care about. OK, so it's a good question. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Potentially, yeah, I mean, typically, I mean, again, it's, we're inferring from behaviour, right? So it's flawed. But um I guess the reason I use use that example is because typically it's the social contract is the society that you're in at the time, right? So if you're going against. The kind of the, the group. So typically people will go with their group, and whatever that group is, doesn't really matter, right? They'll go with that group. So if you go against that group, um. It's kind of indicative of a different, maybe something different motivating your behaviour. That's all. OK, but yeah, it's a fair question. OK. All good. Good. OK. Um, ta da, thank you for your question. Moral reasoning is not the same as moral behaviour. It's a really important point, uh, to be clear on. So take this example for a minute, OK, think about this example. You imagine you're on the bus. Um, there's some woman there and she's being harassed by a random guy. Right, just a random example. OK. Um, another guy comes along and punches the first guy in the face, right? Um, what level of moral reasoning is the second guy functioning at? Hm. Yeah, it could be 2, why could it be 2? Yeah, exactly. So it could be, I mean it's stage, stage level versus thing. So it could be that it's going, society expects me to jump in here. Right, it's what I should do, people are gonna judge me, yep. You say it. Yeah, exactly, so it couldn't be following social order, it would have to be this kind of social contract one about what people expect me rather than following the laws itself. Yeah. Yeah, it could be, he could have overarching ethical principles, and he goes, you don't do that. I'm gonna step it.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah.

SPEAKER 0
Yeah, absolutely. OK, so there are multiple different levels that could explain that behaviour. It might be that he thinks, you know, if I jump in here, I've got a chance with the girl, totally self-interest, I'm gonna get in there. It could be that, you know, and think about other aspects of individuality, like personality that pop in here as well. You can't just look at the stuff by itself, OK? If someone is socially anxious, they're probably not going to do this, but they might answer that they should. OK, they might answer that they should do this behaviour, but they're not gonna do it. Um, also, if they're socially anxious, they might do it because they think other people are gonna judge me if I don't. Right? If they're with their group of friends, they're more likely to do it than if they're not, depending on the age. And the gender ration. Um, they're far more likely to jump in and do something, um, risky when, which we'll see in the adolescent lecture in a minute, when with, when with friends, OK, cause it's kind of, uh. But we'll come across that in the adolescence lecture, it's interesting. The other thing to be aware of is that um. For example, if you look at level 2, stage 3, interpersonal accord and social conformity. We tend to think that's a good thing. You're going along with your social group, right, social expectations. If your social group and your social expectations are anti-social. For example, if you belong to a gang, you spend most of your time with a gang, the expectations and the moral values of that gang are shared by you, um, then those are the social expectations you're working towards, right? So you have to be a bit careful about. Not necessarily a good thing, OK, these levels. Other issues with it, um, one of the really interesting ones, I think, is that, so, um, Gilligan, in the 80s, did some analysis of these data and discovered that, um, Kohlberg's results were based on an entirely male sample. The boys and men. Um, which is obviously a bit missing, right? I mean, it might be the same, but you've got to check it, which is what, um, Gilligan did. And what she found is a few things differ, right, so, um. At the kind of stage 3, stage 4, which is, you can either be conventional, right? But it's either the good girl, good boy one. Or the law and justice, is that, um, on average, again, it's always on average, but on average, males and females tend to differ on whether they move towards the ethics of care or the ethics of justice. Right? So typically, um, again, on average, females tend to be more concerned with ethics of care. Right? So it's more, they're more likely to be in that good girl, good boy stage, right? What's expected, what's the right thing to do, blah, blah, blah, versus males are more typically likely to be in the ethics of justice. OK, so they're more likely to be in that stage. So if you compared adolescents, say, at the same age, males versus females, you'd find different landings in different groups. OK, higher number of boys and ethics of justice. Higher, higher landing of the girls and the good girl, good boy. In other words, focus on relationships and emotional facet versus the kind of cognitive or, uh, kind of rule based side. OK. And that's a problem because um. According to Kohlberg, 4 was higher than 3. Right, Remember, it's hierarchical. Right, so he's saying that 4 is kind of a higher stage, I guess because in his sample, boys at that age who were older were more likely to be doing that than, um, good girl, good boy behaviour, right? So one criticism there is that you can't really compare those two when you're comparing across genders. The other issue with it, or another issue with it, is that it's not actually strictly hierarchical. So people tend to jump around the stages in which they appear to reason, depending on things like context and different moral situations, OK? So, um, For example, different social, um, factors in the scenario, different consequences that might be there as an outcome of behaviour will move people around these different levels. Um, they can also reason at two stages simultaneously. Right, so for one example, they might give one answer. For a different example, they might give another answer depending on context and stuff. So this figure here. Shows you there's this age of participants across the bottom. This is the percent, uh, answering at these different stage levels as we go. And it, it, I mean, it follows basically what Kohlberg said, right? It basically follows the same thing, which is that stage one is almost gone, and it has gone by the age of 18. But I'm the age of 18, no one's answering at that level anymore. They're just saying, I shouldn't do it because it's, you'll get in trouble, right? Stage 2 again follows the same trajectory, it's going down. There's still a bit of it, right? But it's, it's, it's going down. Stage 3, we don't see really at all until we get to about the age of 18 and it's suddenly popping up above 50%. OK. So there's a rapid increase in stage 3, good boy, good girl. What's the right thing to do? Stage 4, following a similar thing, but it's slightly delayed. Yes, so it's coming again, it's after. Um, and then if, around the age of kind of 24, these two kind of, Hobble along together. Yeah, stage 3 and stage 4, which is conventional morality, where most people sit and how they respond to most situations. Stage 5, starts to come in in adulthood, but it's quite low. Right, so that kind of use of that kind of reasoning is quite low. Um, so, generally, criticisms were that the scenarios were not ecologically valid. In other words, if they were actually in a situation, they would do something very different. Right, and there's always a problem with any kind of research into moral behaviour or moral reasoning or moral emotions or whatever, is that unless someone's actually in that situation. You don't actually know what they're gonna do. Right, and other factors come into play as well. Obviously, ethically you generally can't do that, right, you can't put someone on a trolley and give them a lever, um, not allowed. Um, another issue is cultural variabilities, that wasn't really looked at in Kohlberg's original sample. So the relationship between morality and convention, uh, tends to be a little bit different if you're looking at individualist versus collectivist societies. So in a collectivist society, things like the good boy, good girl, the kind of, uh, following social expectations may be seen as actually far more important and far more valuable perhaps than an individualist society. Yes, there are differences in when those come on board. And finally, stage 6 is too rare. It's actually really, really rare for people to respond that way. Now what's interesting, right, is that it doesn't mean that people don't. Necessarily do that kind of level of moral reasoning. It might be that the way we measure it, the way we're looking at it, is just not picking it up. OK, so it's always worth thinking about, uh, are the measurement tools we're using good enough, right? Are they, are they sophisticated enough? Are they sensitive enough to find out what we're looking for? The final reason Is this one. I really like. What is your name?

SPEAKER 2
Leo. And how old are you, Liam? 4. Tell me the story of Christmas. Christmas, cause before Christmas comes to your house and there is a present if he did have reindeer to show it away because he did, if he didn't have any um reindeer. If I'm no greeting, I just have to make a greetings myself words for for Christmas. And it's each day to Christmas for 123456789, 1011, 1230, 40, 150, 160, 1718, 1920, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. 25. We got to build a snowman too, cause are they gonna make, are they gonna give him food. Have we got have normal things like having normal things to each children so they can do it, so. all the time. What did I miss? Oh, you were telling about the school, OK, so I had, I said well I did. I said.

SPEAKER 1
Just slight.

SPEAKER 0
OK, that one. Children under the age of 7, I mean, even older as well, um, find it very difficult to articulate reasons. So you're asking kids to do something that is very complicated for them. OK? You're asking, you're giving them a complex scenario to begin with, and then you're asking them to provide and articulate verbally, a reason for that. OK? So it might be that our data on young kids is actually a bit false, OK? Might need a better measure of, of that kind of thing. What is? Oh, no. This one you don't need to get canvas out, it was just there, so I lived in, um. OK. Kohlberg's theory of the development of moral reasoning is concerned with. Are you ready? Want a moment, a moment. OK. Carlberg's theory of the development of moral reasoning is concerned with blind vote, want to shut your eyes. Is it A, what people use to guide their moral compass? Is it what people think they should do in a given situation? Is it see what people think they would do in a given situation? That how how people feel in a given situation? Or is it E how people think other people would want them to behave in a given situation? Hands down, open eyes. So I can see people were a bit unclear, which is fine. It is specifically it's B, OK, what people think they should do, yeah, in a given situation.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. Um No, I, I mean they would have clearly, I

mean, otherwise, why do it, right? So there would have been to an extent to which um they were interested in the relationship with actual behaviour. I mean, I guess the theory is that if you, if you can't. If you can't think of the reason, you can't think of any reason to do a certain thing, um, or like in those examples, your moral reasoning level determines what answer you give. Right? So with the role example, a kid at the very first level would say, um, they were careless, they did something wrong, so they won't get a role. Probably. Or might they might get in trouble or something like that. Whereas, um, which means they would expect that child to either expect that to happen to them in that situation or maybe behave that way to others. It was kind of the beginning of this kind of field of cognitive moral reasoning, right? Versus a child at a different level who might say, you know, I would give them my role because I feel sorry for them. Now, that might be indicative of, you know, that kind of social contract thing, what's expected, what's the right thing to do, kind of thing. You, you can't. That's the issue, you can't make, you can do this very specific kind of experiments in the lab, but you can't actually, this is the whole issue with this area, right? It's very, very hard to test this with actual behaviour because you can't, you either can't make it feel ecologically valid enough. It's either a setup, right. You can't smash up on the bus, exactly, yeah, yeah. um, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Why wouldn't it be E? Oh, because that's a specific stage. So how people think other people would want them to behave in a given situation is quite indicative of that kind of good girl, good boy stage, or if you're talking about, you know, what policemen think then it would be the stage above that one. Yeah, the overarching thing is what should be done in a given situation. OK. OK. So, Piaget and Kohlberg very much concerned with, as we've just said, what people should do, what people thought they should do in hypothetical scenarios, right? Um, but there's another way of looking at this whole multiple ways of looking at moral development. Another one is to do with um Kind of how children view things as being right or wrong. OK, so their appraisal, if you like, or their judgement of certain actions. So for the first time now, we're looking at the distinction between reasons, so that's cognitive, that's Kohlberg, versus kind of feelings. Is it right or wrong? I it's not feelings as in, do I feel sad, do I feel ashamed, more just that kind of is it, is it sit with me well or not, right? Is it right or wrong? So, um, Turriel and Serana, these are the papers that you've got, if you want to read more. They've argued that very young children, so 36 months is 3, so that and even younger, actually 30 months, they make a distinction between moral, breaking of a moral rule and a social convention. Right? So they can make a distinction between the two. It's actually quite fascinating. So, um, there are two different things, right? Social conventions are basically kind of, um, Rules or uniformities that in some ways help keep a society or a group functioning, right? Obviously read this slide because it gives a much better definition than the one I'm going to give you now. I'm just gonna give you a more overview, right? Um, so it's stuff like shaking hands when you meet someone. Yeah, it's like sitting on the carpet at preschool. It is uh waiting your turn, when it's if you're waiting for someone to open the door, right, it's queuing. All those kind of things are social conventions. um, and the aim of them really is that you make society work better. But there's nothing in and of themselves that is kind of. Harmful, do you know what I mean, there's no actual genuine harm involved in breaking a social convention. If you don't shake someone's hand, they might think you're, you know. Whatever they might think of you, but there's no actual harm to the individual. In contrast, moral prescriptions are the ones where suddenly we see harm involved. Now that could be physical harm, so it involve, you know, physical violence. It could be harm in terms of um. Uh, you know, stealing or taking something that doesn't belong to you, so kind of emotional harm, social harm, um, the moral prescriptions are basically what we think of as universally defined as things we can't do. So it doesn't matter which culture you're in, which society you're in, it'll be considered not the right thing to do. OK. So that's the difference, um. Oh yes, the other particular difference is that the moral prescriptions are um determined by factors inherent to social relationships, OK, as opposed to a particular social organisation, so it's about harming an individual. Yep. Morality taught Um, I would say both. I would say, personally, I would say both. um, in the when most, not all, most kids, for example, if they do something that results in harm to another individual, they find that cue of the other individual being upset quite aversive. Right, um, so. You know, if you're 4, you punch someone, right? Um, and they cry. Most kids will find that crying. Now, they might not demonstrate that. They might not say, you don't have to worry about it. They might not say sorry. They might not, you know, they might even laugh. It doesn't mean they're weird. Um, it just means that they're kind of processing in some way that, that feedback, OK? It's typically quite aversive. On the other hand, um. You know, kids will do that, right, so kids don't, are not born thinking I can't hit, I can't steal, I can't do any of those things, right? They, they'll do them. In fact, they're kind of particularly toddlers are incredibly anti-social, right? Um. Just just without the kind of awareness that it's against, you know. These kind of moral rules that exist. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course, the biggest risk factor for any kid being involved in crime is growing up in a criminogenic environment. If you grow up and nicking stuff is normal, then of course you're gonna nick stuff. Right, because it's, it's, it's normal. It's, it's, you know, there might be a rule somewhere that says it's, you know, the wrong thing to do, but, you know, you're in an environment where it's acceptable, right? Um. Yeah, exactly. So you, you can. Yeah, it's a big risk factor. OK, for example, um, here's a question, is it wrong to not wear clothes? Is that a moral prescription, is that a moral thing or is that a social convention? Social convention. OK, what if you're in uh the Arctic? I'm getting both. I'm getting both.

SPEAKER 1
It's Well, it depends, right?

SPEAKER 0
It depends. If that's your choice, right? If it's the individual's choice, and they're doing some, one of those crazy, like, ice dips or something, um, yeah, sure. It's just social convention is not an issue, right? In fact, it might not even be a social convention. There might be no one else around. It's not an issue. However, if it's not their choice, then you're now inflicting harm, right? If it's not their choice to not have sufficient warmth. Not their choice, OK? So think about, uh, mental illness, like this, I used to work in the Maudsley in London, which is a very kind of a big, not, I worked in a different department, but the Moorsley Psychiatric Hospital was right next door. um. Surprisingly often, actually, there would be people unclothed, walking around with their patients, right? Now, in that sense. Yeah, everyone was a bit awkward, in literally in the lunch queue. Um, literally, it did happen in the lunch queue and there's an individual in front of you completely naked, also in the lunch queue, right? Um, now, that's a social convention, right? Particularly in the context, right? Context, everyone in that context understands what's going on. And someone's calling someone to come and help with that situation, right? But it's a really fine line because, yes, it's, they're breaking a social convention, but at the same time, The person I observing is aware that, you know, this is, this is, there is harm involved here, right? There's an individual that needs assistance here. Right? So the context is really important when you're kind of figuring out whether these are kind of moral things or social conventions. Um OK, so, It has been shown, and this is quite remarkable if you think about it, right, um. Children as young as 30 months, that's 2.5, right? They can make the distinction, reliably make the distinction between moral transgressions, so things that are judged to be more wrong. Like hitting, not sharing, stealing, etc. they are judged by 2.5 year olds to be more serious, more wrong than breaking a social convention. For example, not putting your toys away. Right? That's actually really interesting because they will no doubt have got in trouble for both at some point. Right? It's just different, different quality to it. OK, so these tiny children agreed that the moral transgressions are more serious, more deserving of punishment, and less contextually bound. In other words, they were wrong everywhere. Right, so hitting was wrong everywhere, not putting your toys away was only wrong at preschool, for example. Um, they tested kids between the ages of 2.5 and almost 6, yes? No age differences. So this is something that, bam, they get really early on. They get this really early on, OK? It's really fascinating when you think about kind of your question when you think about parenting, right? So there's good evidence that children are very, very early, very sensitive to different kinds of transgressions. Um And they can make the kind of distinction between the ones that are related to harm and the ones that are related to breaking social rules. There has to be to some extent, um. There has to be experience in. Seeing how adults respond to these transgressions, OK? And that's how they learn to differentiate the two. Is that the difference in the quality, for example, in the way someone reacts, a parent or a caregiver or childcare worker, whatever they are, reacts to a transgression of harm, a moral transgression, versus one of, um, social transgressions. A really good example is sitting on the mat at preschool, you know, they're told to sit on the mat. Sometimes kids don't want to sit on the mat. And I'm sure the response will, the response will be fairly mild, typically, OK? It's like, you know, would you like to come and sit on the map for story time? I can see you don't want to come and sit on the map for story time. You might encourage them. If it's not gonna work, you, you let it go, right? Whereas, if at the same preschool, you know, they, biting is the classic, they, they'll go through a biting phase. If they bite the other, another kid, you know, that needs, that being addressed in a different way. Now, it doesn't mean there's gonna be shouting or, you know, shaming, but it'll be, it'll be. It will be addressed, right? It will be, you know, we can't do this behaviour and, you know, talk about it and whatever the preschool does, they will have different approaches. Typically parents are informed. Um You know, so it's a very different kind of quality about the way that it's, that it's managed. Hopefully, you hope that there's a different quality there, right? Um As we've said, if transgressions of convention cause harm, then they come into a different category. There's a kind of, you can think of some examples where this might happen, right? So, typically, they can, emotional harm might occur, right? So, for example, in some places of worship, it might be expected that certain behaviour is done either kind of head covering or moving shoes, whatever it might be. If that isn't done, you can imagine someone being upset by that, right? It it means something more to them than it does to the person breaking the rule. Right? That's it. Best example I can come up with, right, but it might be like an emotional hurt rather than a. Physical hood. So we might ask this, why is it so obvious to children, young children, 2.5 years old, that some transgressions have a different status? And why then does it seem to take so long for kids to fully comprehend the emotional implications of moral transgressions? In other words, there's a disconnect between the age at which they realise that moral prescriptions and social transgressions are different. And then actually behaving in that way. Right, a 2.5 year old is still gonna be, you know, stealing stuff, hitting stuff, not in a nasty way, but they're still gonna be exploring those kind of boundaries, right? And we might also ask how children's moral understanding is related to their feelings and empathy development, right, so how does the understanding of what's right and wrong, what the right thing to do is relate to. Feelings about other people. Yeah. Mhm. I, it's probably slightly different in that it depends on whether they see that as a moral transgression or not. They might see that as a more of a social convention, depending on how they define an animal, for example. What you do see though in adults, so you answer it, the question is a good one in that, um, despite the fact, I'll show you all the stages that we go through, as adults, we still do things that 3 year olds pass. We, I mean, we, we still do it on a societal level, it's fascinating. So the big one recently was, um, we'll come up to it next. We'll come up to it next week, so I'm not gonna talk about it now, cause I'm gonna run out of time. So, if you get lost, come back to this slide. These areas are really massive. Some of you may be doing philosophy, you've done philosophy. We're not going there, OK? It's too big. We can't compete. So we're just gonna focus on the things that are relevant to developmental psych. OK? There are some really big theories regarding rationalism and sentimentalism. So we've got Kohlberg rules on one side, and emotional consequences and feelings on the other side. OK? Um, We looked at moral judgments today. That's as far as we go, apart from a tiny bit, as far as we go into the foray of the rationalist cognitive side. OK. Next lecture will focus on the sentimentalist tradition, so it's more to do with the kind of social basis of moral systems and looking at intentions, which is where your question comes up, OK? That's it, thank you. Oh, that was tight. Oh, the person who wanted to do an announcement about whatever it was, I can't remember, um, you're welcome to do it now if you want, cos you're only allowed to do them at the end of lectures. So if you wanted to do that, you're welcome.
